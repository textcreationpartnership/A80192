            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable JOHN Lord SOMERS Baron of <hi>Eveſham,</hi> Lord High Chancellor OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN both the Favour and Severity of the Laws were by partial and unuſual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods applyed to the Perſons, and not to the Caſes of the accuſed; when the Life and Honour of an unfortunate Man depended on the Arbitrary Dictates of ſome Men in Authority, and when the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced was more Criminal than the Offence of which the Party was too eaſily convicted; then was your Lordſhip as far from any Advancement to a judicial Office, as your Judgment and Inclinations were from the Approbation of ſuch Proceedings: But no ſooner were places of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Profit in the Law made the unſought Rewards of good and learned Men, but your Lordſhips Merits entituled you to both; whoſe Moderation and Temper will make your Adminiſtration juſt and eaſie in that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:172213:3"/> Court, to which Fortune had no ſhare in your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; and whoſe natural Abilities are ſo improved by a continued and inflexible Study, that your Knowledge is not alone confined to the municipal Laws of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is generally extenſive to all humane Learning.</p>
            <p>What Services may not a Prince expect from the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vigilancy of ſuch a Counſellor? And what Benefit may not a divided People find by your equal Diſpenſation of Juſtice, who (if they can be united in any thing) it muſt be in the general Satisfaction which all have in your Promotion, becauſe they know thoſe Cauſes which come before your Lordſhip will receive a due Hearing and Attention without Paſſion or Prejudice to Perſons; ſuch Emotions being as much beneath the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Lordſhips Mind, as they are beyond the Duty of Juſtice, and fit only for ſuch who will neither be guided by the Rules of Equity or Reaſon; ſo true is that Saying, <hi>Utitur animi motu, qui uti ratione non poteſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reſpect which is due to the Office of Magiſtrates challengeth an univerſal Obedience; but that particular Affection and Eſteem which we have for their Perſons is due only to their Vertues and Merits: And ſuch is that which I have, and all Men (eſpecially thoſe of my Profeſſion) ought to have for your Lordſhip and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> whoſe Learning and Integrity in judicial Determinations may bring the Laws nearer to Perfection; and whoſe Examples are the juſt Commendation of the preſent, and I hope will be the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>I could never underſtand the right meaning of that Sentence, <hi>Boni Judicis eſt ampliare Juriſdictionem</hi> for if that be true, then to what purpoſe were thoſe Arguments at the Bar of the Houſe of Peers againſt
<pb facs="tcp:172213:3"/> ſome late Judges for retaining Bills in Equity, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter whereof was only tryable at the Common Law? Such Complaints are now no more, becauſe your Lordſhip will not only ſupport the Honour and Dignity of that Court, wherein you preſide, in the Beauty of Order, but will not enjoyn any other from exerciſing its proper Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</p>
            <p>Thus will the Credit of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and Men will acquieſce under the legal Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of each Court; very few Writs of Error will be brought for Error in Law, becauſe of the Juſtice and Stability of the Judgment in that Court wherein it was given; and very few Appeals, becauſe your Lordſhip knows ſo well how to temper Equity with Juſtice, that he muſt be a very angry Man, who goes away diſſatisfied with your Lordſhips Decree.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Actions of Men in great Places are ſubject to the various Cenſures of Mankind, if any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Perſon ſhould revive thoſe Diſputes, or quarrel at your Lordſhips Adminiſtration, ſuch Complaints would leave no other Impreſſion upon the Minds of impartial Men than to convince them of the Wrong done to your Lordſhip, and the Folly of ſuch Miſapprehenſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have prefixed your Lordſhips Name to this mean Performance, taking this occaſion to ſhew that great Honour and Reſpect, which I have for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; not that I am ſo vain to think any thing herein to be worthy of your Lordſhips Leiſure, neither do I think it Manners to beg your Lordſhips Patronage, becauſe a good Book will protect it ſelf at all times, and a bad one deſerves no Protection.</p>
            <p>I know few Books are either praiſed or peruſed, but what are warranted by the common Repute and Eſteem
<pb facs="tcp:172213:4"/> of the Writer, which muſt be imputed to the Prejudice and Partiality of Men, and which argues a Diffidence of our natural Parts, as if we did not dare to make a right uſe of our own Judgments: For this Reaſon I have concealed my Name, that a Judgment may not be made of the Book by the Repute of the Writer. But I hope your Lordſhip will not condemn my Ambition, when I ſay, I am not altogether unknown to your Lordſhip, who am</p>

               <p>Three Iuſtices <hi>(abſente North)</hi> gave Iudgment for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, that the Advowſon did paſs by this Grant.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:172213:7"/>
               <p>Iuſtice <hi>Ellis</hi> in his Argument ſaid, That it was plain that when the Mannor came to <hi>H. 8.</hi> the Advowſon was appendant, but when it was granted to the Archbiſhop, and the Advowſon excepted, it then became in groſs, and therefore could never afterward be appendant:<note place="margin">James <hi>and</hi> Johnſon<hi>'s Caſe</hi> Poſtea.</note> As an Aere once diſunited from the Mannor can never after be part of that Mannor, <hi>Liford's</hi> Caſe, <hi>7 Co.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 'tis as plain, that before the Statute <hi>de Praerogativa Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis cap. 15.</hi> That in the eaſe of the King, by the Grant of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, the Advowſon though not named paſſed, much more if it be named in any part of the Deéd, as if it be in the <hi>Habendum</hi> though not in the Premiſſes; but that muſt be intended of an Advowſon appendant.<note place="margin">10 Co. 63.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And though Advowſons are excepted by that Statute, yet in caſe of Reſtitution an Advowſon will paſs by the Words <hi>Adeo plene &amp; integre,</hi> though not named.</p>
               <p>In this Caſe there are general Words and the ſame as in<note n="*" place="margin">10 Co. 63. Poſtea. Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General <hi>againſt</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> 
                  <hi>Whiſtler's Caſe;</hi> yet this differs from that, for here 'tis granted <hi>adeo plene,</hi> as the Abbot had it; by thoſe Words it doth not paſs, for then it was appendant, but now it is in groſs; and if the King intended to paſs an Advowſon as appendant when 'tis in groſs, the Grant is void, <hi>Hob. 303.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Whiſtler's Caſe</hi> there are the Words <hi>Adeo plene,</hi> as in this, and the Advowſon was appendant ſtill, but yet there are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Words here that will paſs it: <hi>Adeo plene <hi>as the Archbiſhop had it,</hi>
                  </hi> will not ſerve, becauſe he never had it; neither will <hi>Adeo plene <hi>as the Abbot had it</hi>
                  </hi> paſs this Advowſon, becauſe he had it in groſs; but <hi>Adeo plene <hi>as the King had it by any ways or means whatſoever,</hi>
                  </hi> thoſe general Words are ſufficient to paſs it.</p>
               <p>The King grants the Mannor and the Advowſon of the Church of <hi>Laburn,</hi> which is certain and by particular Name, part of what follows (as <hi>ſpectan' <hi>to the Archbiſhop</hi>
                  </hi>) is falſe, for it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver belonged to him becauſe it was excepted in the Grant of the Mannor to him, but the firſt diſcription being full and certain the falſity of the other ſhall not avoid the Grant, eſpecially when the King is not deceived in his Title nor in the Value, and when there is a certainty of the thing granted.</p>
               <p>Some falſe ſuggeſtions may make his Grant void, as if he grant the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> reciting that it came to him by Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when it came by Purchaſe, <hi>Hob. 229.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Lane 11.</note>But if the miſ-recital concerns not the Kings Title or Profit, it doth not vitiate the Grant, <hi>10 H. 2. 4.</hi> Sir <hi>John Leſtrange's Caſe,</hi> where the King by Office found had the Wardſhip of a Mannor, and makes a Grant thereof reciting <hi>Quod quidem Manerium in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172213:7"/> manus noſtras ſeiſit<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c.</hi> which was not true, yet the Grant was held good, becauſe it was only to make that certain which was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain enough before by a particular deſcription. So in <hi>Legat's Caſe, 10 Co. 113.</hi> wherein is cited the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> and <hi>Markham,</hi> to whom the Queén had granted the Office of Parker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>&amp;c. quod quidem Officium</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Rutland <hi>habuit,</hi>
                  </hi> when in truth the Earl never had it before, yet the Grant was held good.</p>
               <p>So alſo if he grants for and in conſideration of Service done, or Mony paid, if falſe, it avoids not the Grant, becauſe ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations (when paſt) are not material whether they are true or falſe, <hi>Cro. Jac. 34.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King let the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> of the value of <hi>4 l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> if it be more it is ill, but if he let it by a particular Name, and then adds, <hi>Quod quidem Manerium</hi> is of ſuch a value 'tis good, becauſe the<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cro. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod quidem</hi> is but the addition of another certainty; ſo here the Advowſon is granted by ſpecial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Name, but the Clauſe that follows, <hi>Dudum ſpectan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> to the Archbiſhop, implies a miſtake; and had there beén no more in the Caſe this falſity would never have avoided the Grant.</p>
               <p>But when the King had enumerated ſeveral ways by which he thought he might be intitled, at laſt as a proof that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to paſs it, he adds theſe Words, <hi>viz. as it is in our hands by any way or means whatſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atkins</hi> Iuſtice of the ſame Opinion: Where the thing is not granted by an expreſs Name, there, if a falſity is in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that thing, the Grant is void even in the caſe of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, as if he grant Lands lately let to <hi>D.</hi> in ſuch a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and the Lands were not let to <hi>D.</hi> were alſo in another Pariſh, the Grant is void, becauſe the Lands are not particularly named, <hi>Anderſ. 148. Heywood's Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A fortiori</hi> in the Caſe of the King, as if he grant <hi>omnia illa tenementa ſituata in Wells,</hi> when in truth the Lands did not lie there, for this reaſon the Grant was void, becauſe it was general, and yet reſtrained to a particular Town, and the Pronoun <hi>(illa)</hi> goes through the whole ſentence.</p>
               <p>But if a thing is granted by an expreſs Name, though there is a Falſity in the deſcription, yet in the Caſe of a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon 'tis good.</p>
               <p>As when the Subchantor and Vicars Choral of <hi>Lichfield</hi> made a Grant to <hi>Humfrey Peto</hi> of <hi>78</hi> Acres of Glebe, and of their Tythes Predial and Perſonal, and alſo of the Tythe of the Glebe, <hi>All which</hi> late were in the occupation of <hi>Margaret Peto,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:172213:8"/> which was not true, yet the Grant was adjudged good; for the Words <hi>All which</hi> are not Words of reſtriction unleſs when the Clauſe is general and the Sentence entire, but not when it is diſtinct, <hi>Cro. Car. 548.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the Caſe of the King, if there is a falſity by which the King hath a prejudice, and a Falſity upon the ſuggeſtion of the Party, it will make the Grant void, but every Falſity will not avoid his Grant if it be not to his prejudice.</p>
               <p>But let the Falſity in this Caſe be what it will the <hi>Adeo plene <hi>as it is in our hands</hi>
                  </hi> helps it; and though it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that theſe Words will not help the Grant, becauſe nothing new is granted, that being done before; 'tis true there is nothing new granted, but that which was before was not well granted till this Clauſe came which ſupplies and amends the Falſity; for now 'tis apparent that the King intended to paſs the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon as well as the Mannor, and therefore at laſt grants it, be his Title what it will.</p>
               <p>In all Caſes where the Kings Grant is void becauſe of any miſtake in his Title, 'tis to be intended the King would not make the Grant unleſs the Title were ſo as 'tis recited, but here 'tis apparent the King reſolved to grant it.</p>

               <p>And whether upon this Special Verdict Iudgment ſhould be given for the Plaintiff or the Avowant was the doubt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note>Vpon the point of Pleading Serjeant <hi>Jones</hi> for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſaid it had béen objected that the Avowry was ill, for <hi>ut Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livus, &amp;c. bene cogn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captionem in praedicto loco, &amp;c.</hi> but doth not ſay <hi>tempore quo, &amp;c.</hi> for a Herriot (<hi>tempore quo, &amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>But he anſwered, That that was uſual and common, and of that Opinion were all the Iuſtices, and ſo it was held good.</p>
               <p>It was farther objected, That here is a variance between the Avowry and the finding in the Special Verdict; The Avowant ſays that the Rent was <hi>12 s.</hi> and <hi>4 d.</hi> and the Iury find that it was but <hi>3 s.</hi> and <hi>1 d.</hi> He alſo ſaith, that the Herriot was due upon every Alienation without notice, and they find it due with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice.</p>
               <p>But to that he ſaid, the Iury have doubted only of the laſt Point, for the Avowry was not for Rent but for the Herriot, ſo the ſubſtance is whether he had good cauſe to diſtrein for the Herriot or not.<note place="margin">Poſtea.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And as to that, the Subſtance is ſufficiently found, like the Caſe in <hi>Dyer 115.</hi> Debt upon Bond for performance of Covenants, and not to do waſte, the Breach aſſigned was that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant felled twenty Oakes, who pleads <hi>Non ſuccidit viginti quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus praed' nec earum aliquam,</hi> the Iury find he cut down ten, yet the Plaintiff recovered; for though the intire Allegation of the Breach was not found, becauſe ten did not prove the iſſue of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty literally, yet the Subſtance is found, which is ſufficient to make the Bond forfeited.</p>
               <p>So in Treſpas, where the Plaintiff makes a Title under a Leaſe which commenced on <hi>Lady-day, Habendum à Feſto, &amp;c.</hi> and the Iſſue was <hi>non demiſit modo &amp; forma,</hi> the Iury found the Leaſe to be made upon <hi>Lady-day, Habendum à confectione,</hi> and ſo it commenced upon <hi>Lady-day,</hi> and not <hi>à Feſto, &amp;c.</hi> which muſt be the day after the Feaſt, yet 'twas adjudged for the Plaintiff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the<note n="*" place="margin">Moor 868.

               </p>
               <p>But in <hi>Ejectment</hi> or <hi>Replevin</hi> ſuch a Declaration had been naught, becauſe therein you are to recover the Term, and therefore the Title muſt be truly ſet out, and in <hi>Replevin</hi> you are to have a <hi>Retorn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habend',</hi> but in <hi>Treſpas</hi> 'tis only by way of excuſe. <hi>Sed quaere.</hi>

               <p>A ſecond Reaſon is becauſe both Plaintiff and Defendant in pleading have agréed the matter in this particular, for both ſay the Rent was <hi>12 s.</hi> and <hi>4 d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a Rule in Law, That what the Parties have agreed in pleading ſhall be admitted though, the Iury find otherwiſe, <hi>2 Aſſ. pl. 17. 18 E. 3. 13. b. 2 Co. 4.

               <p>But that muſt be intended of a Debt due upon Contract, and there the leaſt variance will be fatal, <hi>38 H. 6. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the ſecond variance 'tis not material, for 'tis not true as the Avowant hath ſaid, for if the matter in iſſue be found, the finding over is but ſurpluſage; both the Verdict and the Avowry agree that the Defendant may take a Diſtreſs in caſe of Alienation without notice: And ſo he prayed Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>

               <p>It was agréed that the Spiritual Court hath power to compel the Pariſh to repair the Church by their Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, but they cannot appoint what Sums are to be paid for that purpoſe, becauſe the Churchwardens by the conſent of the Pariſh are to ſettle that.</p>

               <p>Afterward he makes his Will in writing (having then no Iſſue but his Wife <hi>groſſement enſeint</hi>) and thereby deviſes the ſame Land to the <hi>Heirs of his Body on the Body of his Wife begotten,</hi> and for want of ſuch Iſſue to the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> the Defendant and his Heirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> dies and about a month after a Son is born, the Son by vertue of this Deviſe enjoys the Land, but when he attains his full age of one and twenty years, he ſuffers a <hi>Common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi> and afterwards deviſes the Land to the Complainant <hi>Nurſe,</hi> and dies.</p>

               <p>The Complainant exhibits a Bill againſt the Defendant to have the Leaſe for 99 years aſſigned to him, and whether he ſhould have it aſſigned or not, was the Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was pretended that an Eſtate in Fée being limited by the Will to <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> who was Leſſee for 99 years, the Term is thereby drowned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was objected, that the Deviſe by <hi>Richard</hi> to the Infant in <hi>ventre la mere</hi> was void, and then the Complainant, who claimed by a Deviſe from the <hi>Poſthumus,</hi> could have no Title, but that the Defendant to whom an Eſtate was limited by the Will of <hi>Richard</hi> in Remainder ſhould take preſently.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding what was objected the Lord Keeper <hi>Finch</hi> decréed that the Leaſe which was in Truſt, ſhould be aſſigned to the Complainant <hi>Nurſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid that at the Common Law without all queſtion a Deviſe to an Infant <hi>in ventre ſa mere</hi> of Lands deviſable by Cuſtom was good, ſo that the doubt ariſes upon the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Roll.

               <p>But in two Caſes in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> one in the time when the Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Hale</hi> was Iudge there, the other in the Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Bridgman's</hi> time, it hath been reſolved that if there were ſufficient and apt words to deſcribe the Infant, though <hi>in ventre ſa mere,</hi> the Deviſe might be good.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> the Iudges ſince have been divided upon this Point, that as the Law ſtands now adjudged, this Deviſe in our Caſe ſeems not to be good: But ſhould the Caſe come now in queſtion, he ſaid he was not ſure that the Law would be ſo adjudged; for 'tis hard to disinherit an Heir for want of apt Words to deſcribe him; and 'tis all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, that a Mans intent, lying <hi>in extremis,</hi> when moſt commonly he is deſtitute of Council, ſhould be favoured.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:172213:13"/>
               <p>It was formerly objected by the Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Vaughan,</hi> that this Warranty goes only to the Heirs, not to the Aſſigns, and here the Eſtate was conveyed by the two <hi>Prinns</hi> before the Warranty attached.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But when the Eſtate paſſeth, the Warranty and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant followeth, and the Aſſignée ſhall have the benefit thereof though not named, and ſo is the Authority of <hi>38 E. 3. 26.</hi> if a Warranty be made to a Man and his Heirs, the Aſſigneé though not named ſhall Rebutt, but he cannot Vouch.</p>
               <p>So if <hi>A.</hi> enfeoff <hi>B.</hi> with Warranty, and <hi>B.</hi> enfeoff <hi>C.</hi> without Déed, <hi>C.</hi> ſhall vouch <hi>A.</hi> as Aſſigneé of the Land of <hi>B.</hi> for the Warranty cannot be aſſigned.</p>
               <p>In this Caſe, though the Warranty did not attach before the Eſtate in the Land was transferred, yet if it attach afterwards 'tis well enough, and he who hath the Poſſeſſion ſhall Rebutt the Demandant without ſhewing how he came by the Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>If a Warranty be to one and his Heirs without the word <hi>Aſſigns,</hi> the Aſſignée indeéd cannot Vouch, but he may<note n="*" place="margin">1 Inſt. 265. a 384.</note> Rebutt; for Rebutter is ſo incident to a Warranty that a Condition not to Rebutt is void in Law: But 'tis otherwiſe of a Condition not to Vouch, for in ſuch caſe you may Rebutt.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, it hath béen an Opinion that he who claimeth above the Warranty, if it be not attached, cannot take benefit of it by way of Voucher or Rebbutter; as if Tenant in Dower maketh a Feoffment to a Villain with Warranty, and the Lord entreth upon him before the deſcent of the Warranty, the Villain can never take advantage of this Warranty by way of Rebutter, becauſe the Lords Title is paramount the Warranty, and he cometh not under his Eſtate to whom the Warranty was made.</p>
               <p>If Land be given to two Brothers in Feé, with Warranty to the eldeſt and his Heirs, the eldeſt dies without Iſſue, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor ſhall not take benefit by this Warranty for the reaſon aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But in the Caſe at Barr the Warranty being collateral and annexed to the Land, goeth with the Eſtate, and whilſt that continues the Party may Vouch or Rebutt; ſo here the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant though he be only Tenant at Will, for the Eſtate is in the Bargainors, and their Heirs (there being no Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it either by Livery or Enrolment) yet he may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butt.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:172213:14"/>
               <p>Iuſtice <hi>Atkins</hi> was of the ſame Opinion, that by this collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Warranty the Entry of the Leſſor of the Plaintiff was taken away, for 'tis the nature of a collateral Warranty to be a Barr; a<note n="*" place="margin">Jones Rep. 199, 200. 1 Inſt. 366, 385. 25 H. 6. 63. Bro. Gar. 4.</note> Right is bound by it; it extinguiſhes a Right, 'tis annexed to the Land and runs with it.</p>
               <p>If then a collateral Warranty be of this nature, 'tis againſt all reaſon, that he who is thus bound ſhould make any Title to the Land; but 'tis very reaſonable that he who comes in <hi>quaſi</hi> by that Eſtate ſhould defend his Title.</p>

In this Caſe it was held, that if it had béen found that <hi>Margaret</hi> had an Eſtate for Life, and that <hi>Henry</hi> entred in her Life time, that it had beén then a Warranty commenced by Diſſeiſin and would not have bound <hi>Thomas</hi> the Reverſioner.

               <p>
                  <hi>Newdigate</hi> Serjeant, for the Demandant, argued, That the Plea was not good, to which he tooke ſeveral Execeptions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Except.</hi> The Tenant by his Plea confeſſeth, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant ought to have Iudgment of the <hi>Reverſion expectant upon the Leaſe</hi> for 99 years, <hi>de tertia,</hi> but doth not ſay, <hi>parte.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Then for the Matter, as 'tis pleaded, 'tis not good: He agreed, if Dower be brought againſt Leſſee for years, he may diſcharge himſelf, by pleading the continuance of his Leaſe, during which time, the Demandant can have no Execution; but here the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is no ways concerned in the Leaſe; 'tis <hi>Littleton's</hi> Caſe, None ſhall take advantage of a Releaſe, but he who is party or privy, and therefore the Leſſee in this Caſe, being party, might have pleaded this, but the Tenant is altogether a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Before the Statute of <hi>Glouceſter, cap</hi> 11. If the Demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant had recovered, in a real Action againſt the Tenant, the Termor had been bound, becauſe, at the Common Law, no body could falſifie the Recovery of a Free-hold, but he who had a Free-hold himſelf; this Statute prevents that Miſchief, and Enacts, <hi>That the Termor ſhall be received before Judgment, to defend the Right of his Term, upon the default of the Tenant,</hi> and though the Iudgment cannot be hindred thereby, yet Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhall be ſuſpended, during the Term; and therefore in <hi>Dyer</hi> 263. <hi>b.</hi> The Lady <hi>Arundel</hi> brought Dower againſt the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who made default, and before Iudgment the Termor prays to be received upon this Statute, and pleads a Leaſe made by the Husband, after Coverture, which was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him, and that Dower <hi>de tertia parte,</hi> of the Rent of this Leaſe, was aſſigned to the Demandant, by the Court of <hi>Augmentations,</hi> which was afterwards confirmed by Letters Patents; that ſhe accepted it, and concludes, That the Plea of the Tenant was by Colluſion, between him and her, to make him loſe his Term; And this was held ill, for the Reaſon given by my Lord<note n="*" place="margin">Hob 316. Not for that reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Court could not aſſign Dower, and ſo the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents of Confirmation could not make that good which was void be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> 
                  <hi>Hobart, That it is abſurd to admit two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to diſpute the Intereſt of a third Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whether the <hi>Traverſe</hi> is good or not, if the Plea is naught, Iudgment ought to be given for the Demandant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> Serjeant <hi>contra:</hi> The Pleading is well enough.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Tenant confeſſeth, That the Demandant ought to have Iudgment of the Reverſion <hi>de tertia,</hi> which is well enough, omitting the word <hi>(parte)</hi> becauſe he claims a third part of ſuch Tenements; and the Tenant confeſſes ſhe ought to have Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is full enough, if the words <hi>de tertia parte</hi> were wholly omitted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He agreed, That whoever Claims under a Deed, muſt ſhew it; but the Tenant, in this Caſe, did not defend himſelf
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172213:15"/> by any Title from the Deed, for the ſubſtance of the Plea, which ſecured him, was, That a Leaſe of 99 years was in being, and by his alledging the Deviſe of an Eſtate to him for Life, made by the Grantee of the Reverſion, he did but allow the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant's Writ to be true, which mentions him as Tenant of the Free-hold.</p>
               <p>Then for the Matter of the Plea, he ſays it was good, and that the Tenant might well plead the Leaſe for years.</p>
               <p>By the<note n="*" place="margin">3 Inſt. 32. b.</note> Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> Damages are given in Dower, where the Husband died ſeiſed, which he did in this Caſe; but yet no Damages ought to be paid here, but for the third part of the Rent, and the third part of the Reverſion, and therefore to acquit himſelf thereof, he may well plead, as here, for which there is a Preſident in <hi>Hern's Pleader</hi> 335.</p>
               <p>Then he ſaid, That the Traverſe was ill, for the principal Point in the Plea which he ought to have traverſed, was the continuance of the Term; and 'tis not material who granted the Reverſion, or to whom it was granted; for if there is a Leaſe in being, the Demandant cannot have Execution.</p>
               <p>The Court were all of Opinion, That the ſubſtance of the Plea was good, becauſe there was a privity in the Grantee, and it was for his benefit to avoid the Demandants Seiſin, he being thereby entituled to the Rent, and he may plead this Plea, to ſave himſelf from Damages given by the Statute of <hi>Merton:</hi> But as to the Traverſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iuſtice, and <hi>Wyndham</hi> Iuſtice, inclined, That the Traverſe was well taken; for if a Diſſeiſor pleads the like Plea, as here, 'tis not good, and therefore when the Tenant alledges a Grant of the Reverſion, the Demandant may well traverſe it.</p>
               <p>But Iuſtice <hi>Ellis</hi> and <hi>Atkyns</hi> were of Opinion, That the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe was immaterial, for it was the Leaſe and not the Grant that was traverſable.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it was alledged by the Demandants (who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to refer it to the Council on the other ſide) that this Leaſe ſo pleaded, was an old Mortgage, long ſince ſatisfied; it was referred accordingly.</p>

               <p>The circumſtances of the Caſe were:</p>
               <p>A <hi>Feme ſole</hi> had divers Debts owing to her by <hi>Specialty,</hi> ſhe marries the Plainiff, and died, (the Bonds being not put in ſuit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Coverture) the Plaintiff adminiſters, and her Brother ſues to have a diſtribution; and it was inſiſted for him, that a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation</hi> ought to go becauſe the<note n="*" place="margin">22 &amp; 23 Car. 2. c. 10.</note> Statute extendeth to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and therefore the Husband, though not named, ſhall make diſtribution, like the Statute <hi>de Donis</hi> which only mentions ſome Eſtates Tail; but it has been held that there are ſeveral other Eſtates Tail beſides thoſe particular inſtances there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>The Title of this Act is general, and there is no Preamble to reduce it to particulars; the enacting and proviſional Clauſe ſpeaks in threé places of all perſons dying inteſtate, within which general words a Feme Covert, as well as others, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>But on the other ſide it was ſaid that this Caſe is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in that Act which provides only where the Husband dies inteſtate.</p>
               <p>As to what was objected, that this Act is a general proviſion and extends to all Caſes of the like nature, the Title of it alſo being general, <hi>For ſetling of Inteſtates Eſtates;</hi> to that it was ſaid, that before the making this Act there were many doubts in thoſe Caſes againſt which a Proviſion was thereby made, and therefore it well became the Prudence of that Parliament to take away all Scruples, and to ſettle thoſe things which were ſo apt to be queſtioned: But no doubt was ever made before this Statute to whom Adminiſtration of the Wives Eſtate ſhould be committed; for by the Statute of <hi>31 Ed. 3. cap. 11.</hi> Power was given to the Ordinary to commit Adminiſtration to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:172213:16"/> the beſt Friend of the Inteſtate; and therefore it has beén agréed that the<note n="*" place="margin">4 Co. 51. Ognel's Caſe. Cro. Car. 106.

               <p>And 'tis agréed on all ſides, that no Diſtribution is to be made by an Adminiſtrator; for if any Suit had been commenced in the Spiritual Court to that purpoſes, a Prohibition was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently granted. What need was there to ſettle this Matter by Act of Parliament, which was ſo clear before?</p>
               <p>And 'tis the more unlikely that the Eſtates of Feme Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts ſhould be intended to be diſpoſed by this Act, when 'tis conſidered that all their Eſtates conſiſt only in things in Action, which the Husband might releaſe during the Coverture (for all the Goods in poſſeſſion are by Law veſted in the Husband by the intermarriage) and therefore ſuch inconſiderable things may be well intended not worthy the care and proviſion of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Husband and Wife are but one perſon in Law, and this Act provides for the ſettling Inteſtates Eſtates; now the Wife cannot be ſaid to die inteſtate, when her Husband (the better part) ſurvives.</p>
               <p>Before the making thoſe Acts of <hi>31 Ed. 3. cap. 11.</hi> and <hi>21 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> the Ordinary might have granted Adminiſtration to a Stranger; but now by the firſt of thoſe Laws he is reſtrained to the next Friend, and by the other to the Widow or next of Kin; ſo that the power which he had at the Common Law, and which was too often by him abuſed, being now reſtrained, Adminiſtration muſt be granted as preſcribed by this Law, and no equitable conſtruction can take it from the Husband; for how can it be intended that the Parliament would take from him that Right which he had by thoſe former Laws, and prefer the Relations of his Wife before him?</p>
               <p>But if the Wife ſhall be adjudged an Inteſtate within this Act then the Husband muſt loſe all her Eſtate in Action, and he will be then alſo within the rules of diſtribution; ſo that he muſt be at all the labour and pains of Adminiſtration (which muſt be granted to him) to defend and get in the Eſtate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit, for he muſt only deduct his Expences out of the Profits, and diſtribute the overplus.</p>
               <p>He is intituled to the Adminiſtration within the Statute of <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> He is alſo intituled to it within the Clauſe of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>H. 8.</hi> which Enacts, <hi>That 'tis to be granted to the Wife or next of Kin;</hi> and it ſeems very unreaſonable that he ſhould have no profit for his labour.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:172213:17"/>
               <p>Laſtly, A Feme Covert can never be intended to dye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate within the meaning of this Act; for that Clauſe which directs what Bond the Ordinary ſhall take of the Adminiſtrator is very remarkable to this purpoſe, which provides, <hi>That if it appear the deceaſed made any Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Action was laid in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and upon Not-Guilty pleaded, the Cauſe came to Tryal, and there was a Verdict for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baldwyn</hi> Serjeant moved in arreſt of Iugdment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Except.</hi> That the Action ought not to be laid in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> but in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where the <hi>Tort</hi> was committed.</p>
               <p>But as to that it was anſwered by Serjeant <hi>Turner,</hi> when two Matters, both of which are material and are laid in two Counties, the Action may be brought in either, as if two libel in the Admiralty for a Contract made at Land in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and for which the Plaintiff brings an Action in <hi>London</hi> againſt one of them, it has been adjudged the Action lies in either County.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Except.</hi> The Action will not lie againſt the ſix Coroners, for the <hi>Tort</hi> was done by one alone.</p>
               <p>As to that it was ſaid, all the Coroners are but one Officer; ſo if one Sheriff ſuffer an Eſcape, both are liable; but in this Caſe it had been ill to have brought the Action only againſt one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172213:18"/> the ground of it is the falſe Return, which was made by ſix Coroners.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt Exception, there could be no doubt now, ſince after Verdict 'tis<note n="*" place="margin">Stat. 16 &amp; 17 Car. 2. c. 8.</note> helped though the Trial be in a wrong County.</p>
               <p>But the Court ſaid that Statute helps a <hi>Miſtrial</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per County, but not where the County is miſtaken; and inclined likewiſe that this Action was well brought againſt the ſix for this Tort committed by one Coroner; but if it had béen for not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting the Party, in ſuch a Caſe it ought to have been brought againſt the Coroner who was preſent with the perſon to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted; for that had béen a <hi>perſonal Tort</hi> which could not have been charged upon the reſt.</p>

               <p>This was argued by <hi>Jones</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff, and by <hi>Seys</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>And for the Plaintiff it was ſaid,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> that <hi>Robert</hi> had but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for Life: 'Tis true in moſt Caſes the Word <hi>paying</hi> makes a Fee, where there is no expreſs Fee limited; but the difference is, <hi>viz.</hi> where the Mony to be paid is a Sum in groſs, let it be equivalent or not to the value of the thing deviſed, the Deviſee ſhall have a Fee, though the Eſtate be not deviſed to him and his Heirs; but if it be an annual payment out of the thing deviſed, as in this Caſe, it will not create a Fee without apt words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Deviſée hath no loſs, and therefore it hath beén held that if a Deviſe be made to two Sons, to the intent that they ſhall bear equal ſhare towards the payment of <hi>40 l.</hi> to his Wife for Life; the Sons had only an Eſtate for Life becauſe 'tis <hi>quaſi</hi> an annuel Rent out of the Profits and no Sum in groſs,<note n="*" place="margin">Jones 211.</note>

               <p>All Deviſes are intended for the benefit of the Deviſeé, and therefore where a Sum in groſs is deviſed to be paid which is done accordingly, in ſuch Caſe if the Deviſeé ſhould die ſoon after, the Mony would be loſt, if he ſhould have only an Eſtate for Life; but in the Caſe at Bar the Teſtator by a nice calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had appointed when the firſt payment ſhould be made, <hi>viz.

               <p>It was agreed, where payment is to be made by which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſee can ſuſtain no loſs, the Word <hi>Paying</hi> there will not make a Fée, but if there be any poſſibility of a loſs there it will create a Fee, which is the expreſs reſolution in <hi>Collier's Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the five pounds is payable quarterly, and the firſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be made the next Quarter after the death of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, ſo as it be a Month after his deceaſe; if then he ſhould die a Month before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> the Deviſeé is to pay the whole quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly payment at <hi>Chriſtmas:</hi> So that if he ſhould dye the next day after, inſtead of having any benefit, he would loſe by this Deviſe in caſe it ſhould be conſtrued that he had an Eſtate only for Life.</p>
               <p>The Court were of Opinion that a Legacy or Deviſe is always intended for the benefit of the party; ſo that 'tis reaſonable to make ſuch conſtruction of the Will, that he may have no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a loſs.

               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiff demurred,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> and Serjeant <hi>Jones</hi> maintained the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer, and ſaid, that the Pleading of <hi>nullum fecerunt Arbitrium</hi> is not good; for 'tis ſaid <hi>de praemiſſis</hi> only, whereas it ſhould have been <hi>nec de aliqua parte inde;</hi> for if a Bond be to perform an Award of two perſons or either of them, it will not be ſufficient to plead that thoſe two perſons made no Award, without adding <hi>nec eorum aliquis.</hi>

               <p>He took a difference, where an Inferiour Court hath an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Iuriſdiction of the Cauſe, and hath conuſance of ſuch a Suit as is brought there; for in ſuch Caſes the proceedings are not extra-judicial; but if an Action is brought where properly no Action doth lye, all the proceedings there are <hi>coram non Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</hi>

               <p>But the Court were all of Opinion, that Iudgment ſhould be given for the Plaintiff; for his remedy was very proper upon the Convention, and without the Statute of Confirmation; and here is no Eſtoppel in the Caſe; for whether this was an act of Hoſtility or not, is not material; neither was it or could it be an Iſſue upon the former Tryal, becauſe all the Matter then in Queſtion was concerning the Treſpaſs, which, though found againſt the now Plaintiff, yet it might be an act of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility; but if it were an Eſtoppel, 'tis not well pleaded with a Traverſe, and the Court hath ſet it at large.</p>

               </p>

                  <hi>Barrell</hi> for the Defendant; though this Law be in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative; yet ſince it doth not prejudice any perſon, neither can it be injurious if <hi>Scavengers</hi> are choſen as directed by the Act, it ſhall be taken as a Negative Clauſe; and for this many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be given; as, the Statute for deviſing part of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators Land, doth not take away the cuſtom to deviſe the whole, for that would be an apparent prejudice to the Parties; but not ſo in this Caſe, where 'tis not found that the Lord of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſuſtains any loſs, for he is to have nothing when a <hi>Scaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> is choſen in the Leet; nor are the Inhabitants prejudiced, for by this New chooſing their Streets ſhall be kept as clean as before.</p>
               <p>The Form here eſtabliſhed doth not conſiſt with the Cuſtom, and ſo hath the Effect of a Negative Clauſe, <hi>Hob. 298.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears by the Scope of the Act, That the intent of the Parliament was to take away thoſe old Cuſtoms of chooſing,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:172213:26"/> becauſe the Cuſtoms are expreſſly ſaved in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi> but in all other places a new way is appointed.</p>
               <p>The pavement of the Streets in <hi>Southwark</hi> ſhall be as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but that Clauſe goes no farther, and therefore concerns not the Caſe of a Scavenger, whoſe duty is not to pave, but cleanſe the Streets.</p>
               <p>And the words, <hi>viz. Liberties of the City of London,</hi> will not help, becauſe <hi>Southwark</hi> is not comprehended under them, in that Clauſe, no more than are the Lands which they have in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> for the word <hi>Liberties</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Poſtea 48.</note> there, is taken for Limits, and can admit of no other Conſtruction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that the Plaintiff cannot have Iudgment, becauſe he hath no alledged the Cuſtom to be, That the Steward may Fine, in caſe of the refuſal to take the Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Cuſtoms are to be taken ſtictly.</p>
               <p>The Chief Iuſtice and Iuſtice <hi>Atkins</hi> ſaid, That 'tis true, <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers</hi> are under the power of the Court Leet, by Cuſtom, and in caſe of refuſal may be fined, as well as an <hi>Ale-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Act of Parliament having taken notice, that there were <hi>Scavengers</hi> before that time, and <hi>Southwark</hi> being therein named as diſtinct from the Liberties of <hi>London;</hi> for 'tis provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That <hi>Weſtminſter, London,</hi> and the Liberties thereof, and <hi>Southwark</hi> are to have the Streets paved, as before, which doth not belong to the Office of a <hi>Scavenger;</hi> and ſo that Clauſe in the Act concerns not this Caſe.</p>
               <p>But where it Enacts, <hi>That in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter, Scaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> ſhall be choſen as before;</hi> but in all other places appoints a new way; this is as much as if it had ſaid, That <hi>Scaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> ſhall be choſen in every place as by the Act preſcribed, and no other way, except in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and ſo great is the inconſiſtency between the Cuſtom and the Act, that they cannot ſtand both together; therefore, though the Act is but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, the Cuſtom is ſuſpended, and though it may be ſome damage to the Lord to make ſuch Conſtruction, yet that will not alter the Caſe; for Law-Makers are preſumed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the publick Good more than to any private Mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and the Lord may be ſaid in this caſe to have diſpenſed with his Intereſt, being a Party to the Act, and conſenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Wyndham</hi> and <hi>Ellis</hi> Iuſtices, inclined, That the Cuſtom did continue, becauſe the Act was in the Affirmative; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon of this difference is, becauſe in Fines there are Covenants, which, though they are real in reſpect of the Land, yet 'tis but a perſonal Action, in which the Land is not demanded <hi>ex directo;</hi> but in a Recovery greater preciſeneſs is required, that being a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> where the Land it ſelf is demanded, and the Defendant muſt make Anſwer to it, <hi>Cro.

               </p>
               <p>Liberties in Iudgment of Law are incorporeal, and therefore 'tis abſurd to ſay that Lands which are corporeal ſhall be therein contained.</p>

               <p>A Common Recovery is held good of an Advowſon; and no Reaſons are to be drawn from the <hi>Viſne,</hi> or the Execution of the Writ of Seiſin, becauſe 'tis not in the Caſe of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Procéedings, but by Agréement of the Parties, where 'tis to be preſumed each knows the others meaning.</p>

                  <hi>QUare Impedit.</hi> The King was intituled to a Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Statute of <hi>31 Eliz. cap. 6.</hi> becauſe of a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal Contract made by the rightful Patron, and he according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did preſent.</p>
               <p>Then comes the Act of General Pardon, <hi>21 Jac. cap. 35.</hi> by which under general Words (it was now admitted) that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was pardoned: In which Act there is a beneficial Clauſe of Reſtitution: <hi>viz. The King giveth to his Subjects all Goods, Chattels, Debts, Fines, Iſſues, Profits, Amerciaments, Forfeitures and Sums of Mony forfeited by reaſon of any Offence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whether the Kings Preſenteé or the Patron had the better Title was the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>This Caſe was only mentioned now, but argued in <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Term following by Serjeant <hi>Jones,</hi> that the Kings Preſenteé is intituled; he agreed that Symony was pardoned, but not the conſequences thereof; for 'tis not like the Caſe where a Stroak is given at one time and death happens at another; if the Stroak, which is the firſt offence, is pardoned before the death of the party, that is a Pardon likewiſe of the Felony; for 'tis true the Stroak being the cauſe of the death, and that being pardoned all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effects are pardoned with the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>But legal Conſequences are not thus pardoned; as if a Man is outlawed in Treſpaſs, and the King pardons the Outlawry, the Fine remains, <hi>6 E. 4. 9. 8 H. 4. 21. 2 Roll. Abr. 179.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:172213:32"/>
               <p>In this Act of Pardon, there are words of Grant, but the Preſentation is not within the Clauſe of Reſtitution; for 'tis an Intereſt and not an Authority veſted in the King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a thing of another nature than what is intended to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; becauſe it is higher, and ſhall not be comprehended amongſt the general words of Goods and Chattels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are things of a lower nature, and are all in the perſonality, <hi>Cro.

               <p>
                  <hi>Conyers</hi> Serjeant, argued for the Title of the Patron,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> and ſaid, that there were three material Clauſes in this Act.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> A Pardon of the Offences therein mentioned in general and particular words.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That all things not excepted ſhall be pardoned by general words, as if particularly named.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> The Pardon to be taken moſt favourably for the Subject; upon which Clauſes it muſt neceſſarily follow, that this Offence is pardoned, and then all the conſequences from thence dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced will be likewiſe pardoned; and ſo the Patron reſtored to his Preſentation, for all Charters of Reſtitution are to be taken favourably, <hi>Pl. Com. 252.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Preſentation veſts no legal Right in the Preſentee; for in the Caſe of the King, 'tis revocable after Inſtitution and before Induction, <hi>Co. Lit. 344. b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe a ſecond Preſentation will repeal the firſt, <hi>Rolls 353.</hi> And if the Kings Preſentee dies before Induction, that is alſo a Revocation; if therefore the Party hath no legal Right by this Preſentation, and the King by the <hi>Simony</hi> had only an authority to preſent, and no legal Intereſt veſted, then by this Act he hath revoked the Preſentation, and the right Patron is reſtored to his Title to preſent.</p>
               <p>The Court were all of Opinion <hi>(abſente Ellis)</hi> That the Kings Preſentee had a good Title, and by conſequence the Patron had no right to Preſent this turn; for here was an Intereſt veſted in the King; like the Caſe where the King is intituled to the Goods of a <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> by Inquiſition, and then comes an Act of Indempnity, that ſhall not diveſt the King of his Right.</p>
               <p>But where nothing Veſts before the Office found, a Pardon before the Inquiſition extinguiſhes all Forfeitures, as it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Tomb's</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>So if the Pardon in this Caſe had come before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, the Party had been reſtored <hi>Statu quo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:172213:33"/>
               <p>The King can do no more, the Biſhop is to do the reſt; neither is the Preſentation revoked by this Act; it might have been revoked by implication in ſome Caſes; as where there is a ſecond Preſentation; but ſuch a general revocation will not do it: and Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, and a Writ of Error brought, but the Cauſe was ended by Agreement.</p>

               <p>The Plaintiff pleads in barr to the Avowry, and <hi>traverſeth,</hi> that the Defendant was lawfully charged with the ſaid Rent; and the Defendant demurred.</p>

               <p>But the Chief Iuſtice doubted, that for the ſecond Exception the Plea was ill, for it ought to be on a day certain, and likewiſe it ought to be alledged <hi>infra Juriſdictionem.</hi>

               <p>To this Plea the Plaintiff demurred, and the Defendant joyned in Demurrer which was argued by <hi>Turner</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff, and by Serjeant <hi>Seys</hi> for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>This was a bad Plea, for 'tis a Rule in all Law Books, that every Plea ought to anſwer the matter which is charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Defendant,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> in the Declaration, which is not done here,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:172213:43"/> becauſe the Defendant doth neither aver that he did accompt, or confeſs or avoid, or traverſe it, which he ought to do, after the Plaintiff had alledged a requeſt to accompt, and a refuſal.</p>
               <p>'Tis an abſolute Covenant which charges him to be accompta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and not if the Plaintiff would allow Parſons Dinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for 'tis impoſſible that the Plainntiff can make any ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, till the Defendant hath accompted; for how can there be a diſcounting without an Accompt?</p>
               <p>If the Plaintiff had told him before the Accompt, that he would not allow any thing upon the Accompt, this would not have been prejudicial to bart him of his Action, ſo as it had been before the requeſt: For if a Man makes a Feoffment in Fee, upon condition that if the Feoffor pay <hi>100 l.</hi> at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> the Feoffment ſhall be void; and before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> the Feoffee tells him that he will not receive the Money at that time; this ſhall not prejudice him, becauſe tis no refuſal in Law.</p>
               <p>The Defendant in this Caſe is to do the firſt act, <hi>viz.</hi> to Accompt; and when that is neglected by him, it ſhall never prejudice him who is to do a ſubſequent act, <hi>5 Co. 19, 20. Higginbottoms Caſe, 22 &amp; 23 Hallin and Lambs Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Covenants to make an Eſtate in fee, at the Coſts of the Covenantee; the Covenantor is to do the firſt act, <hi>viz.</hi> to let him know what Conveyance he will make.</p>
               <p>The like Caſe was in this Court, between <hi>Twiford</hi> and <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> upon an Indenture of Covenants, wherein one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did Covenant to make a Leaſe for the Life of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantee, and for two other Lives, as he ſhould name, and the Covenantor was to give poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The breach aſſigned was, that the Defendant had not made Livery and Seiſin, and upon performance pleaded, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff did demux, and upon great debate it was reſolved that the Covenant was not broken, becauſe the Plaintiff had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that which was firſt to be done on his part, <hi>viz.</hi> to name the Lives.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, that theſe Covenants have a relation one to the other; and ſo non-performance of the one, may be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in bar to the other.</p>
               <p>But to that he anſwered, they are diſtinct and mutual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and there may be ſeveral Actions brought againſt each other. The Caſe of<note n="*" place="margin">Stiles 186. 187.</note> 
                  <hi>Ware</hi> and <hi>Chappel</hi> comes up to this point. <hi>Ware</hi> was to raiſe <hi>500</hi> Soldiers, and bring them to ſuch a Port, and <hi>Chappel</hi> was to find Shipping, for which he ſued upon the Covenant, though the other had not raiſed the Soldiers; for that can be only alledged in mitigation of Damages, and is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172213:44"/> no excuſe for the Defendant, and it was adjudged, that this was not a condition precedent, but diſtinct and mutual Covenants, upon which ſeveral Actions might be brought.</p>
               <p>This cannot be a Condition precedent, for the Defendant pleads, <hi>&amp; ulterius agreat<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; proviſum eſt</hi> that the Plaintiff ſhall diſcompt and reimburſe the Defendant; and here the word <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſum eſt</hi> doth not make a Condition but a Covenant, <hi>27 H. 8. 14, 15. Bro. Condition 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another fault in the Plea, for the Defendant averrs, that the Plaintiff hath not reimburſed him ſeveral Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which is altogether incertain, for it doth not appear what is due, <hi>28 H. 8. Dyer 28. 9 Ed. 4. 16. 12 H. 8. 6. a.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note>But it was argued for the Defendant, that he need not Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the Accompt.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Objection made, that the Plea is not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not anſwer the Declaration, the Rule as to that purpoſe is generally good; but then the Plaintiff muſt tell all his Caſe, which if he omits, he muſt then give the Defendant leave to tell where his omiſſion is.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a thing which belongs properly to another, may be pleaded in bar, or diſcharge, to avoid circuity of Actions; as one Covenant may be pleaded to another, <hi>1 H. 7. 15. 20 H. 7. 4.</hi> So where the Leſſeé is to be diſpuniſhable of waſte, he may plead it to a Writ of waſte.</p>
               <p>The Books note a difference where the Covenant is one or two Sentences; for in the firſt caſe one Covenant may be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in diſcharge of another, but not in the laſt, <hi>Keilway 34.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, if the ſecond Covenant had been diſtinct and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, it could not have been thus pleaded; but in this Caſe 'tis not ſaid, that the Covenantor, for himſelf, his Executors and Adminiſtrators doth Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>ulterius agreat<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; proviſum eſt;</hi> ſo that as tis penned <hi>proviſum eſt</hi> makes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and then the ſenſe is, I will accompt if you will diſcompt, and if you refuſe to diſcompt, I cannot be charged, <hi>Dyer 6.</hi>

               <p>And all this is regularly true in the Caſe of a Fréehold: But if the conſtruing of it to be a Leaſe will work a Wrong, then 'tis only a Covenant or Agreément and no Intereſt veſts, and therefore it ſhall never be intended a Leaſe in this Caſe, becauſe 'tis in the Caſe of a Copyhold Eſtate; for if it ſhould, there would be a Wrong done both to the Leſſor and Leſſée; for it would be a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Eſtate of the one, and a defeating of the Security of the other.</p>
               <p>It has beén generally uſed in ſuch Caſes to conſider what was the intention of the Parties, and not to intend it a Leaſe againſt their meaning, for which there is an expreſs Authority, <hi>2 Cro. 172.</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Evans <hi>and</hi> Thomas,</hi>

               <p>The Aſſurance was not made, and this was adjuged no Leaſe for thirtéen years, becauſe it was the intent of the Parties to make an Aſſurance only in the nature of a Mortgage, which is but a Covenant.</p>
               <p>And this appears likewiſe to be the intention of the Parties here, becauſe in the very Deed 'tis recited that the Lands are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pihold.</p>
               <p>It alſo ſounds directly in Covenant, for 'tis that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall or may enjoy without the lawful let or interruption of the Leſſor.</p>
               <p>All Agreements muſt be conſtrued <hi>ſecundum ſubjectam materiam</hi> if the Matter will bear it, and in moſt Caſes are governed by the intention of the Parties and not to work a Wrong; and therefore if Tenant in Tail makes a Leaſe for Life, it ſhall be taken for his own Life; and yet if before the Statute of Entails he made ſuch
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:172213:46"/> Leaſe, he being then Tenant in Fée-ſimple, it had been an Eſtate during the Life of the Leſſée; but when the Statute had made it unlawful for him to bind his Heir, then the Law conſtrues it to be for his own Life, becauſe otherwiſe it would work a Wrong,<note place="margin">Hob. 276.</note> 
                  <hi>Co. Lit. 42.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in this caſe it ſhall not amount to a Leaſe for the manifeſt inconveniency which would follow, but it ſhall be conſtrued as a Covenant, and then no injury is done.</p>
               <p>On the Defendants part it was argued by Serjeant <hi>Newdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> that though this was in the Caſe of a Copyhold,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> that did not make any difference; for the plain meaning of the Parties was to make a Leaſe: But where the Words are doubtful and ſuch as may admit of diverſe conſtructions, whether they will amount to a Leaſe or not, there they ſhall be taken as a Covenant to prevent a Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>So alſo if they are only Inſtructions, as if a Man by Articles ſealed and delivered is contented to demiſe ſuch Lands, and a Rent is reſerved, and Covenants to repair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Where the Parties ſhall join in an Action, where not.</note>THE Defendant covenanted that he would not agreé for the taking the Farm of the Exciſe of Beer and Ale for the County of <hi>York</hi> without the Conſent of the Plaintiff and another, and the Plaintiff alone brought this Action of Covenant, and aſſigns for breach, the Defendants agréeing for the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe without his Conſent, upon which the Plaintiff had a Verdict and 1000 <hi>l.</hi> damages given.</p>
               <p>And Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> moved in Arreſt of Iudgment, for that an Action of Covenant would not lie in this Caſe by the Plaintiff alone, becauſe he ought to have joined with the other, both of them having a joint Intereſt, and ſo is <hi>Slingſby's Caſe</hi> 5 <hi>Co.</hi> If a Bond is made to two joyntly and ſeverally they muſt both join in an Action of Debt, ſo here 'tis a joint contract, and both muſt be Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs: So alſo if one covenants with two to pay each of them 20 <hi>l.</hi> they muſt both join.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, in <hi>Slingſbies Caſe</hi> 'twas held if an Aſſurance is made to <hi>A.</hi> of <hi>White Acre,</hi> and to <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Black Acre,</hi> and to <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>Green Acre,</hi> and a Covenant with them and every of them, theſe laſt Words make the Covenant ſeveral.</p>
               <p>But here is nothing of a ſeveral intereſt, no more than that one covenants with two, that he will not join in a Leaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Conſent, ſo that their Intereſt not being divided the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhall be entire and taken according to the firſt Words, to be a joint Covenant; and the rather, becauſe if the Plaintiff may maintain this Action alone, the other may bring a ſecond Action, and the Defendant will be ſubject to entire damages which may be given in both.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Judgment.</note>But the Court was of another Opinion, that here was no joint Intereſt but that each of the Covenantees might maintain an Action for his particular damages, or otherwiſe one of them might be remedileſs; for ſuppoſe one of them had given his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that the Defendant ſhould farm this Exciſe, and had ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received ſome ſatisfaction or recompence for ſo doing, is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that the other ſhould loſe his remedy who never did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, For which reaſon the Plaintiff had his Iudgment.</p>

               <p>THE Plaintiff brought an Action on the Caſe againſt the Sheriff for a falſe Return,<note place="margin">Caſe lies not againſt the Sheriff for return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Cepi Corpus &amp; paratum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo,</hi> though the Party doth not appear.

               <p>The Defendant pleads the Statute of <hi>23 H. 6. cap. 10.</hi> and ſaith that he took Bail, <hi>viz.</hi> two ſufficient Sureties, and ſo let him go at large, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiff demurrs; and whether this Action lies againſt the Defendant was the Queſtion, who refuſed to proceed againſt him by way of Amerciament, or to take an Aſſignment of the Bail-Bond.</p>
               <p>This Caſe depended in Court ſeveral Terms. It was argued by Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Coniers</hi> for the Plaintiff, and by Serjeant <hi>George Strode</hi> for the Defendant; and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term in the <hi>29th</hi> year of this King.</p>
               <p>In the Argument for the Defendant that this Action would not lie it was conſidered,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> What the Common Law was before the making of this Statute.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> What alteration thereof the Statute had made.</p>
               <p>At the Common Law Men were to appear perſonally to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Writ, the Form of which required it, and no Attorney could be made in any Action till <hi>Edw. 1. de gratia ſpeciali</hi> gave leave to his Subjects to appoint them and commanded his Iudges to admit them, <hi>2 Inſt. 377.</hi> After the Arreſt the Sheriff mighttie the Party to what Conditions he pleaſed, and he might keep him till he had complied with ſuch Conditions, which often ended in taking extravagant Bonds, and ſometimes in other Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for remedy whereof this Statute was made, in which the Clauſe that concerns this Caſe is, <hi>viz. If the Sheriff return upon any perſon <hi>Cepi Corpus</hi> or <hi>Reddidit ſe,</hi> that he ſhall be chargeable to have the Body at the day of the Return of the Writ in ſuch form as before the making the Act;</hi> ſo that as to the Return of the Writ this Statute hath made no alteration, the Sheriff being bound to have the Party at a day as before.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:172213:48"/>
               <p>All the alteration made of the Common Law by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is that the Sheriff now is bound to let the Party out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon reaſonable Sureties of ſufficient perſons, which before he was not obliged to do; and it would be a Caſe of great hardſhip upon all the Sheriffs of <hi>England,</hi> if they (being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to let out the Party to Bail) ſhould alſo be ſubject to an Action for ſo doing, becauſe they have him not at the day; ſo that the intent of the Law muſt be (when it charges the Sheriff to have the Body at the Return) that he ſhould be liable to a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty if the Party did not then appear, not to be recovered by Action but by Amerciament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cro. Jac. 286.</note>The Security directed by this Act is to be taken in the Sheriffs own Name; 'tis properly his buſineſs and for his own Indempnity, and therefore it is left wholly in his power; for which reaſon no Action will lie againſt him for taking inſufficient Bail, that being to his own prejudice, in which the Plaintiff is no wiſe concerned; for if that had beén intended by the Act ſome Proviſion would have beén made as to his being ſatisfied in the ſufficiency of the Perſons.</p>
               <p>When the Security is thus taken, if the Defendant doth not appear at the Return of the Writ, the Plaintiff by Amerciaments ſhall compel him to bring in the Body, or to aſſign the Bond, either of which is a full ſatisfaction and as much as is required.</p>
               <p>If the Sheriff refuſe to take<note place="margin">2 Sand. 59, 154 1 Roll. Abr. 807, 808. Cro. Eliz. 460, 852. Noy 39. Moor 428.

               <p>This Action is grounded upon a falſe Return, when in truth there is no Return made, or if any, 'tis a very imperfect Return till the Body be in Court; and this is the reaſon why the Court will not allow it, but amerce the Sheriff till he make the Party appear; 'tis not like a compleat Return, as a <hi>Non eſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or the Return of <hi>Nulla Bona</hi> upon a <hi>Fi.

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe the Aſſignment of the Bail Bond is at the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Court, and not demandable by the Plaintiff <hi>in foro.</hi>

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:172213:48"/>
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Plaintiff hath no benefit by the Amerciaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they go to the King, and in ſome places are granted to Patenteés; now 'tis agreéd that the Sheriff may be amerced, and certainly if an Action be brought againſt him he is but in the ſame Caſe, for ſtill he is to pay: And if it be objected, that the Amerciaments may be compounded cheaper, then the Plaintiff hath not ſo good remedy, nor is ſo likely to recover his Debt, as if the Action would lie, which would be a greater penalty upon him than the Amerciaments on the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>Neither will it follow that becauſe the Sheriff may be amerced therefore no Action will lie againſt him; for in many Caſes he may be amerced, and yet an Action on the Caſe will lie againſt him at the Suit of the Party, <hi>41 Aſſ. pl. 12. fol. 254. Latch 187.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this Action will not lie is againſt the very end of the Statute, and the reaſonable conſtruction thereof in the laſt Clauſe, which Enacts, <hi>That if the Sheriff return a <hi>Cepi Corpus,</hi> he ſhall be charged to have the Body at the Return as before the making of the Statute;</hi> now before this Law he was lyable to an Action, if after ſuch a Return made the Party did not appear, and therefore this Action being grounded upon the Common Law, is ſtill preſerved ſince no alteration hereof hath beén made by this Statute.</p>
               <p>'Tis true an Action of Eſcape is taken away, but not an Action on the Caſe for a falſe Return, and upon this difference are all the Authorities cited on the other ſide, as <hi>Cro. Eliz. 416, 621. Cro. Jac. 286. Moor 428.</hi> and the Caſe of <hi>Bowls</hi> and <hi>Laſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for an Authority in Point is the Caſe of <hi>Franklin <hi>and</hi> Andrews 24 Car. 1.</hi> where Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff in an Action brought for a falſe Return of <hi>Cepi Corpus;</hi> and the Statute pleaded as in this Caſe. It has béen objected that Iudgment was there given upon the defect of Pleading, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Traverſe was naught; 'tis true there was a Traverſe, <hi>abſque hoc quod</hi> the Defendant <hi>retornavit aliter vel alio modo;</hi> but that was held good becauſe it anſwered the <hi>falſo</hi> alledged in the Plaintiffs Declaration: In this Caſe there is no Traverſe, but 'tis confeſſed by the Demurrer that he did falſly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully return <hi>Cepi Corpus,</hi> and ſo the Plaintiff is at apparent damage and hath no remedy without this Action, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant is at no prejudice but hath his remedy over on the Bail Bond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iuſtice, <hi>Wyndham</hi> and <hi>Atkins</hi> Iuſtices,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> held that the Action would not lie; for when the Sheriff returns <hi>Cepi Corpus &amp; paratum habeo,</hi> though he have him not in Court 'tis
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:172213:49"/> no falſe Return; for if he hath taken Bail, he hath done what by Law he ought to do; if he Arreſt a Man in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the Law will not compel him to bring the Party hither to the Bar, becauſe of the charge; if he make an inſufficient Return, neither the Party or the Court are deluded, becauſe the common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in ſuch caſes muſt be purſued, by which the Party will have remedy. This Return is true; and Iuſtice <hi>Atkyns</hi> held, that the Sheriff was not obliged by the Statute to return only a <hi>Cepi Corpus &amp; paratum habeo,</hi> but might return, that he took Bail; for the Statute provides, that if he return a <hi>Cepi Corpus,</hi> he ſhall be chargable as before, but doth not enjoyn him to make ſuch return; the Caſe of <hi>Bowles</hi> and <hi>Laſſels</hi> is full in this point, and therefore Iudgment was given for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>But Iuſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> was of another Opinion; ſays he, this Action being brought becauſe the Defendant ſaid he had the Body ready, when in truth he had not, was an apparent injury to the Plaintiff, of whom the Statute muſt have ſome conſideration; for it doth not require the Sheriff to ſay <hi>Cepi corpus &amp; paratum habeo,</hi> but he muſt make his Return good, or otherwiſe thoſe words are very inſignificant; and if the Statute obliges him to let the party to Bail, and nothing more is thereby intended for the benefit of the Plaintiff, why doth the Court amerce the Sheriff, and puniſh him for doing what the Statute directs? Therefore if the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff brings a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> upon the <hi>Cepi,</hi> and the Defendant doth not appear the Plaintiff, is then well entituled to this Action.</p>

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:172213:49"/>
               <p>The Articles mention an Agreement of a Marriage to be had between the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis Hollis</hi> and <hi>Lucy Carr,</hi> with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants on the Plaintiffs ſide to ſettle a Ioynture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and on the other ſide to pay <hi>6000 l.</hi> and 'tis agreed in the Articles, that a Fine was intended to be levied of ſuch Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſecuring the payment of <hi>6000 l. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marriage takes effect, but old Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> did never Seal theſe Articles; the Lady <hi>Carr</hi> Seals before, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant after Marriage.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis</hi> had Iſſue on his Lady <hi>Lucy,</hi> one Child ſince dead; the Lady is likewiſe dead; the Ioynture was not made, nor the Portion paid.</p>
               <p>Afterward, <hi>viz. Anno 1664.</hi> an Act of Parliament was made for ſetling old Sir <hi>Robert Carr's</hi> Eſtate, whereby the Truſteés therein named, are appointed to ſell it for payment of Debts, and raiſing this Portion; by which Act all Conveyances made by old Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> ſince the year <hi>1639.</hi> are made void, except ſuch as were made upon valuable conſiderations; but all thoſe made by him before the ſaid year, with power of revocation (if not actually revoked) are ſaved; and in the year <hi>1636.</hi> he had executed a Conveyance, by which he had made a Settlement of his Eſtate in Tayl, with a power of revocation; but it did not appear that he did ever revoke the ſame.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the Lands appointed by this Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to be ſold by the Truſtees, are the Lands compriſed in that Settlement; and now, after the death of Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> the Plaintiff exhibits his Bill againſt the Son, (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch a Settlement was made in the year <hi>1636.</hi> till the Defendant had ſet it forth in his Anſwer:) and by this Bill he deſires that the Truſtees may execute their Truſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he may have relief.</p>
               <p>On the Defendants ſide it was urged,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> that after the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age there was a Bond given for an additional Ioynture, and it was upon that account that the Defendant was drawn in to execute theſe Articles: And if the very reaſon and foundation of his entring into them failed, then they ſhall not bind him in Equity; and in this Caſe it did fail, becauſe the Plaintiff had diſabled himſelf to make any other Ioynture, by a Pre-convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made and executed by him, of his whole Eſtate; and if this agreement will not bind him, then this Court cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Plaintiffs remedy, or appoint more than what by the Articles is agreed to be done; neither can the Defendants ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incumber the Eſtate Tayl in Equity, becauſe the Lands were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:172213:50"/> not then in him, his Father being Tenant in Tayl, and then living; and the ſubſequent deſcent by which the Lands are caſt upon him, alters not the Caſe; for the very right which deſcends is ſaved by the Act from being charged.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide it was argued, that though the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age did proceed upon the Defendants ſealing, yet the Aſſurance which was to be made, was a principal Motive thereunto; and it being agreed before Marriage, though not executed, it was very juſt that he ſhould Seal afterwards; and though the additional Ioynture was not made, yet there was no colour that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſhould break his Articles, for that reaſon; becauſe if the Bond be not performed, 'tis forfeited and may be ſued; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared in the caſe, of any Conveyance made by Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> whereby he had diſabled himſelf to make an additional Ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he hath expreſly denied it upon his Oath. And though it was was objected, that the Money was raiſed by the old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Carr,</hi> and by the direction of the Truſtees lodged in the hands of one <hi>Cook,</hi> who is become inſolvent; It was anſwered that there was no proof of the conſent of the Truſtees, and therefore this payment cannot alter the caſe.</p>
               <p>After the matter thus ſtated, the Lord Chancellor delivered his Opinion, That the <hi>6000 l.</hi> is doe to the Plaintiff, unpaid and unſatisfied; for though the Marriage had not taken effect, yet the Covenant binds the Defendant, becauſe a Deed is good for a Duty, without any conſideration.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Plaintiff has remedy againſt the perſon of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant at Law, for this <hi>6000 l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> He has remedy againſt ſuch of the Defendants Lands, which are not compriſed in the Settlement made <hi>1636.</hi> for as to them the Truſtees may be enjoyned to execute the Truſt.</p>
               <p>And he deſired the Opinions of the two Iuſtices, if any thing more could be done in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Iuſtice <hi>Windham</hi> was of Opinion, that nothing more could be done, but to make a Decree to enforce the execution of the Truſt.</p>
               <p>And Iuſtice <hi>Wild</hi> ſaid, that the Plaintiff has his remedy at Law againſt the Defendant, and upon the Act of Parliament againſt the Truſtees; but upon theſe Articles no Decree could be made to bind the Lands, for that would be to give a much better ſecurity than the Parties had agreed on. But if there had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:172213:50"/> been a Covenant in the Articles, that a Fine ſhould be levied, it might have been otherwiſe; 'tis only that a Fine is intended to be levied.</p>
               <p>But as to that the Lord Chancellor was of Opinion, that it was a good Covenant to levy a Fine, for the words <hi>(Articles of Agreement, &amp;c.)</hi> go quite through, and make that Clauſe a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but becauſe Iuſtice <hi>Wild</hi> was of another Opinion, he deſired the Attorny General to argue theſe three Points.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Whether this was a Covenant to levy a Fine or not.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> If it was a Covenant, whether this Court can decree him to do it, for though the Party has a good remedy at Law; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Court might not give remedy upon the Land.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> If it was a Covenant to levie a Fine, and the Court may decree the Defendant to do it, yet whether ſuch a Decree can be made upon the prayer of this Bill, it not being particularly prayed; for the Plaintiff concluded his Bill, with praying relief in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Truſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term following theſe Points were argued by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Maynard,</hi> Sir <hi>John Churchil,</hi> and Sir <hi>John King</hi> for the Plaintiff; Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> and Mr. <hi>Solicitor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Keck</hi> for the Defendant, all in one day, and in the ſame order as named.</p>
               <p>The Councel for the Defendant urged,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> that this was no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in Law to enforce the Defendant to levy a Fine: 'Tis agreéd that there is no need of the word <hi>(Covenant)</hi> to make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but any thing under the Hand and Seal of the Parties, which imports an Agreement, will amount to a Covenant; ſo in <hi>1 Roll.

That the Leſſee ſhall repair,</hi> make a Covenant; ſo in the Caſe of Indentures of Apprentiſhip there are not the formal words of a Covenant, but only an Agreement that the Maſter ſhall do this, and the Apprentice ſhall do that, and theſe are Covenants; but in all theſe Caſes there is ſomething of an undertaking; as in <hi>1 Roll 519. Walker <hi>verſus</hi> Walker,</hi> If a Deed be made to another in theſe words, <hi>viz. I have a Writing in my cuſtody, in which W. ſtandeth bound to B. in 100 l. and I will be ready to produce it;</hi> This is a Covenant, for there is a preſent engaging to do it, but there are no ſuch words here, 'tis only a recital, <hi>That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Fine is intended to be levied to ſuch Uſes, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis only Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive to another Clauſe, without poſitive or affirmative words, and therefore can never be intended to make a Covenant, but are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:172213:51"/> recited to another purpoſe, <hi>viz. To declare the Uſe of a Fine, in caſe ſuch ſhould be levied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Articles of Agreement are executed in conſideration of an intended Marriage, and one ſide Covenants to do one thing, and the other ſide another thing; was it ever imagined that upon theſe words, <hi>(Whereas a Marriage is intended, &amp;c.)</hi> that an Action of Covenant might be brought to enforce the Marriage: And yet there is as much reaſon for the one as the other; therefore ſince the Parties have neither made nor intended it for a Covenant, 'tis not neceſſary that it ſhould be ſo conſtrued.</p>
               <p>If this is a Covenant, the Parties at Common Law could only bring an Action of Covenant, and recover damages for not levying of the Fine, and that the Plaintiff may do now upon the expreſs Covenant for non-payment of the Money; but then the breach muſt be aſſigned according to the words, <hi>viz. That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant did not levy a Fine as intended;</hi> who may plead that a Fine was never intended to be levied, and by what Iury ſhall this be tryed?</p>
               <p>It may be objected, that every Article ſtands upon its own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and the Title of them (being <hi>Articles of Agreement,</hi>) extends to every Paragraph.</p>
               <p>But as to that, each of theſe Articles is to be conſidered by it ſelf; and every Paragraph begins, <hi>viz it is Covenanted, &amp;c.</hi> which ſhews it was never intended to make it a Covenant, by the Title of the Articles, and the rather, becauſe 'tis unreaſonable to make ſuch a conſtruction; for it is not to be ſuppoſed that a Man will covenant that a Fine ſhall be levied, as in this Caſe, by <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and himſelf, when 'tis not in his power to compel another.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Admitting it to be a Covenant, yet it would be very hard to decree the execution of a Fine <hi>in Specie;</hi> for the Father of the Defendant was alive when he executed the Deed, and the Father being Tenant in Tayl, who never ſealed, the Son could have no preſent Right, who did Seal; and if matters had ſtood now as then, how could a Court of Equity Decree a Fine, by which a Right might be extinguiſhed, but could never be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and by which no uſe could be declared? For though ſuch a Fine be good by <hi>Eſtoppel,</hi> before the Tayl deſcends to the Iſſue; yet no uſe can be declared thereupon, nor upon any Fine by <hi>Eſtoppel;</hi> and there is no reaſon why length of time ſhould put the Plaintiff into a better condition than he was when the Articles were executed.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:172213:51"/>
                  <hi>3.</hi> And laſtly, ſince here is a particular relief prayed in no wiſe concerning the levying of this Fine, but only a Relief in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Truſt, this Court cannot Decree the Defendant to levy one, it being againſt the conſtant courſe and rules thereof.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide it was ſaid by the Plaintiffs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that the words do declare the intent of the Parties,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> that a Fine ſhall be levied; and 'tis the Intent which makes the Agreement; and where there is an Agreement an Action of Covenant will lye.</p>
               <p>If a Man Covenant to do ſuch a thing in conſideration of a Marriage, and then there is this Clauſe, <hi>viz. Whereas it is intended that he ſhall Marry before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> that then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> certainly upon the whole Deed here is a good Covenant to marry before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Caſe 'tis Covenanted, that <hi>6000 l.</hi> ſhall be paid, and that it ſhall be ſecured as herein is after mentioned; then 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that a Fine is intended to be levied for that purpoſe, this is a good Covenant to make a Security by a Fine.</p>
               <p>But if the particular manner how the the Security was to be made had been omitted, yet upon the words <hi>(Covenant to ſecure it,)</hi> the Court hath a good ground to make a Decree to levy a Fine, that being the only way to ſecure it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> As to the Objection, that the Defendant had but a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of having the Eſtate when he entred into this Couenant, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to be ſo) yet why ſhould that be a reaſon to hinder him from making good the Security when he hath it; if Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son Covenant to make an Aſſurance, the Father who had the Eſtate in poſſeſſion dies, the Decree muſt then operate upon that Eſtate in the hands of the Son.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Here is a general prayer for a proper relief, in which the Plaintiffs Caſe is included, and therefore prayed Iudgment for him.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor,<note place="margin">Curia.</note> preſently after the Arguments on each ſide, delivered his Opinion, That upon the whole frame of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles there was a Covenant to levy a Fine; for wherever there is an Agreement under Hand and Seal, Covenant lies; that in this Caſe there was a plain Covenant, if the firſt Article of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving farther ſecurity, be coupled to that Paragraph of intending to levy a Fine, for that is the farther ſecurity intended, ſo that the meaning of the Parties runs thus; I do intend to levy a Fine, which is for the Securing of <hi>6000 l.</hi> and this appears to be their Agreement. Now there are many Caſes where words
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:172213:52"/> will make a Covenant, becauſe of the Agreement, when the general words of <hi>Covenant, Grant, &amp;c.</hi> are wanting; as<note n="*" place="margin">Hays <hi>verſus</hi> Bickerſtaff. Antea &amp; Poſtea. Cook <hi>verſus</hi> Herl.</note> 
                  <hi>Yielding</hi> and <hi>Paying</hi> will make a Covenant, for the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Party having provided himſelf of real as well as perſonal Security, by theſe Articles, he ſaid he would not deprive him of it; eſpecially when it might be more trouble to bring an Action of Covenant for the not levying of the Fine, for upon that many Queſtions might ariſe, as who ſhould do the firſt act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which reaſons he decreed the execution of the Fine <hi>in Specie.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Henly</hi> Prothonotary of the Court of <hi>Kings Bench</hi> makes a Grant of the Office of Clark of the Papers (which of right did belong to him) unto Mr. <hi>Vidian</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> for their lives and the life of the longeſt liver of them.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Mr. <hi>Vidian</hi> makes a parol Surrender of this Grant, and then Sir <hi>Robert Henley</hi> makes a new Grant to Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aſton</hi> the Defendant for their Lives, and for the life of the Survivor: Mr. <hi>Vidian</hi> dies, and whether the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff <hi>Woodward</hi> ſhould have all the profits of the Office by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivorſhip was the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>It was agreed that this was one entire Office; and as one of them cannot make a Deputy ſo he cannot appoint a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.</p>
               <p>But the doubt was whether the Plaintiff had not conſented that the Defendant ſhould be taken into the Office, and had agreed to the new Grant which was made afterwards; for it was
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:172213:54"/> admitted that if he conſented before Mr. <hi>Aſton</hi> came in, it muſt then be found for the Defendant; for by his conſent he had barred himſelf of his Right and Benefit of Survivorſhip, and that by his conſenting to the new Grant that in Law was a Surrender of the firſt Grant, and then the Defendant is jointe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Plaintiff, and if ſo, his Action is not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>And upon theſe two Points only it was left to the Iury, who found for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The Evidence to the firſt Point was, that when Mr. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> propoſed to the Court that the Defendant might ſucceed him, after ſome oppoſition and unwillingneſs in the Plaintiff to agreé to it; yet at length he declared that he did ſubmit to it, and accordingly the Defendant was admitted; but there was no formal Entry of his Admittance as an Officer, but only the Courts declaring their Conſent that he ſhould take his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>On the other ſide it was inſiſted on for the Plaintiff and proved that his Submiſſion to the Court was with a <hi>ſalvo jure,</hi> and what he did was <hi>reluctante animo,</hi> thinking it was a hardſhip upon him, as he often ſince declared; ſo that it was <hi>quaſi</hi> a compulſory Conſent made in obedience to the Court with whom it was not good manners in him to contend.</p>
               <p>Several Points were ſtirred at the Trial, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether a Surrender of the Grant of an Office by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol was good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether if a Grant be made of an Office or of any other thing which lies in Grant, and the Deed is loſt or cancelled, the Office or the thing granted falls to the ground, for the Deed is the foundation; and a Caſe was cited in the Lord <hi>Dyer;</hi> If there be two Iointenants and one cancels the Deed it hath deſtroyed the Right of the other, <hi>Quaere</hi> of theſe things: But it was agreed, that if two Men who have one Office for their Lives and the ſurvivor of them, if one ſurrenders to the other, and then a new Grant is made to this other and a Stranger, he hath debarred himſelf of the Survivorſhip, and he and the Stranger are jointly ſeiſed.</p>

               <p>As to the third Exception it was anſwered, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff neéd not recite the Statute it being a<note n="*" place="margin">Sid. 348.</note> general Law; and admitting there was no neceſſity, yet if he will undertake to recite it and miſtake in a material Point, 'tis incurable; but if he recites ſo much as will ſerve to maintain his own Action truly and miſtakes the reſt, this will not vitiate his Declaration; and ſo he hath done here by reciting ſo much of the Statute which Enacts, <hi>That no Man ſhall ſpeak any ſcandalous Words of an Earl,</hi> which is enough (he being an Earl) to entitle him to an Action, and he concludes <hi>prout per eundem Actum plenius liquet;</hi> and the Court grounded themſelves principally upon a Iudgment given in this Court which was thus, <hi>viz.</hi> There was a Robbery committed, and the Party brought an Action upon the Statute of <hi>Huy</hi> and <hi>Cry,</hi> in which he recited <hi>incendia domorum,</hi>

               <p>When this Cauſe was tried at the Barr which was in <hi>Eaſter-Term</hi> laſt, the Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> offered to give his Teſtimony for the Plaintiff, but refuſed to be ſworn, offering to ſpeak upon his Honour; but Iuſtice <hi>Wyld</hi> told him in Cauſes between Party and Party he muſt be upon his Oath.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> asked him whether he would anſwer it: The Iudge replyed, that he delivered it as his Opinion, and becauſe he knew not whether it might cauſe him to be queſtioned in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, he deſired the reſt of the Iudges to deliver their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which they all did, and ſaid he ought to be ſworn; and ſo he was, but with a <hi>ſalvo jure;</hi> for he ſaid there was an Order in the Houſe of Peers, <hi>That 'tis againſt the Priviledge of the Houſe for any Lord to be ſworn.</hi>

If they are burned or he is robbed without his own default, he is not lyable; and in this Caſe it was not pleaded that he could not ſell the Goods for ready Mony; and the Sale it ſelf was made beyond Sea, where the Buyer is not to be found; like the Caſe of<note n="*" place="margin">1 Bulſt. 103.

                  <hi>INformation.</hi> The Caſe was, <hi>Viz.</hi> The King by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents granted ſeveral Lands in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> by expreſs words; and then this Clauſe is added, upon which the Queſtion did ariſe, <hi>Nec non totum illud fundum &amp; ſolum &amp; terras ſuas contigue adjacen'</hi> to the Premiſſes, <hi>quae ſunt aqua cooperta vel quae in poſterum de aqua poſſunt recuperari;</hi> and afterwards a great quantity of Land was gained from the Sea; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King or the Patentee was intituled to thoſe Lands, was the Queſtion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Deviſe of a poſſibility good by a common perſon. 2 Cro. 509. pl. 21. 1 Bulſt. 194.</note>
                  <hi>Sawyer</hi> for the King argued, that he had a good Title, becauſe the Grant was void, he having only a bare <hi>poſſibility</hi> in the thing granted at the time.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Levins</hi> on the other ſide inſiſted, that the Grant of thoſe Lands was good, becauſe the King may Grant what he hath not in poſſeſſion, but only a poſſibility to have it. But admitting that he could not make ſuch a Grant; yet in this Caſe there is ſuch a certainty as the thing it ſelf is capable to have, and in which the King hath an Intereſt; and it is hard to ſay that he hath an Intereſt in a thing, and yet cannot by any means diſpoſe of it.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be objected, that nothing is to paſs but what is <hi>contigue adjacen'</hi> to the Premiſſes granted, and therefore an Inch or ſome ſuch ſmall matter muſt paſs and no more; certainly that was not the intention of the King, whoſe Grants are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued favourably, and very bountifully for his Honour, and not to be taken by Inches.</p>

                  </note>If there are two Marſhes adjoyning, which are the Kings, and he grants one of them by a particular name and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then he grants the other <hi>contigue adjacen' ex parte au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrali,</hi> certainly the whole Marſh will paſs; and 'tis very uſual in pleading to ſay a Man is ſeiſed of a Houſe or Cloſe, and of another Houſe, <hi>&amp;c. contigue adjacen',</hi> that is to be intended of the whole Houſe.</p>
               <p>In this Caſe the King intended to paſs ſomething when he granted <hi>totum fundum, &amp;c.</hi> but if ſuch conſtruction ſhould be made as inſiſted on, then thoſe words would be of no ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis true, the word <hi>illud</hi> is a Relative, and reſtrains the general words, and implies that which may be ſhewn, as it were

               <p>But if the Patent is not good by the very words of the Grant, the <hi>non obſtante</hi> makes it good, which in this Caſe is ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that it ſeems to be deſigned on purpoſe to anſwer thoſe Objections of any miſtake or incertainty, in the value, quantity, or quality of the thing granted, which alſo ſupplies the defects for want of right inſtruction given the King, in all caſes where he may lawfully make a Grant at the Common Law, 4 <hi>Co.</hi> 34.<note place="margin">Moor pl. 571.</note>

                  <hi>1.</hi> Such a Conſtruction ſeems moſt agreeable to the intention of all the Parties to the Fine.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> It may well ſtand with the Nature and the Words of the Fine.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> It will be moſt agreeable both to the Iudgments and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which have formerly béen given in the like Caſes.</p>
               <p>And as to the firſt of theſe it will be neceſſary to conſider what will be the effect and conſequence of levying this Fine both on the one ſide and the other. It cannot be denyed but that there was a Purchaſe intended to be made under this Fine, and that the Parties were willing to paſs away their Eſtate with the leaſt hazard that might be to themſelves; neither can it be imagined that they intended to defeat this Purchaſe as ſoon as it was made, which they muſt do if this Fine works a Forfeiture; for then he in Remainder in Tail is entituled to a preſent Entry, and ſo the Eſtates for Life which the Baron and Feme had are loſt, and there was a poſſibility alſo of loſing the Reverſion in Feé, which the Tenant in Tail after his Entry might have barred by a Common Recovery.</p>
               <p>And had not the Parties intended only to paſs both the Eſtates, which they lawfully might paſs, why did they levy this Fine <hi>ſur conceſſit?</hi> They might have levyed a Fine <hi>ſur Cogniſance de droit come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> and that had beén a Diſſeiſin.</p>
               <p>Beſides what need was there for them to mention any Eſtate which they had in theſe Houſes, if they had intended a Diſſeiſin? But this being done, ſuch a Conſtruction is to be made as may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the intent of the Parties; and it would be very unreaſonable, that what was intended to preſerve the Eſtate ſhould now be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to work a Diſſeſin ſo as to forfeit it; and ſuch a Diſſeiſin upon which this collateral Warranty ſhall operate and barr the Eſtate in Remainder.</p>
               <p>And therefore no more ſhall paſs by this Fine than what lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may; and rather than it ſhall be conſtrued to work a Wrong, the Eſtate ſhall paſs by fractions; for both the Eſtates of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Mitton</hi> for Life, are not ſo neceſſarily joyned and united by this Fine that no room can be left for ſuch a Conſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Such a Conſtruction will not agreé with the Nature and Words of this Fine. 'Tis true, a Fine as it is of the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and of the greateſt Authority, ſo 'tis of the greateſt force and efficacy to convey an Eſtate, and the moſt effectual Feoffment of Record where 'tis a Feoffment, and likewiſe the moſt effectual Releaſe, where 'tis to be a Releaſe.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:172213:62"/>
               <p>But on a bare Agreément made in Actions betwéen the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant and Tenant at the Barr, and drawn up there, the Iudges will alter and amend ſuch Fines, if they did not in all things anſwer the intention of the Parties.<note place="margin">24 Ed. 3. 36.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Poſtea.</note>'Tis agreed that Fines can work a Diſſeiſin when they can have no other Interpretation, as if Tenant <hi>pur auter vie</hi> levy a Fine to a Stranger for his own Life, 'tis more than ſuch a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant could do, becauſe his Eſtate was during the Life of another and no longer.</p>
               <p>So a Fine <hi>ſur Cogniſance de droit, &amp;c.</hi> implies a Fée, which being levyed by any one who has but a particular Eſtate will make a Diſſeiſin.</p>
               <p>But this Fine <hi>ſur conceſſit</hi> has beén always taken to be the moſt harmleſs of all others, and can be compared to nothing elſe than a Grant of <hi>totum ſtatum ſuum &amp; quicquid habet, &amp;c.</hi> by which no more is granted than what the Cogniſor had at the time of the Grant, and ſo it hath been always conſtrued.</p>
               <p>Indéed there is a Fine <hi>ſur conceſſit</hi> which expreſſes no Eſtate of the Grantor, and this is properly levyed by Tenant in Fée or Tail; but when particular Tenants paſs over their ſeveral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates they generally grant <hi>totum &amp; quicquid habent in tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis praedictis,</hi> being very cautious to expreſs what Eſtate they had therein.</p>
               <p>When this Fine <hi>ſur conceſſit</hi> was firſt invented the Iudges in thoſe days looked upon the Words <hi>quicquid habent, &amp;c.</hi> to be inſignificant, and for that reaſon in <hi>Anno 17 E. 3. 66.</hi> they were refuſed: The caſe was; Two Husbands and their Wives levied ſuch a Fine to the Cogniſee, and thereby granted <hi>totum &amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid habent, &amp;c.</hi> which Words were rejected, and the Iudge would not paſs the Fine, becauſe if the Party had nothing in the Land then nothing paſſed; and ſo is <hi>44 Ed. 3. 36.</hi> By which it appears that the Iudges in thoſe times thought theſe Fines did paſs no more than what the Cogniſor had; and for this there are multitude of Authorities in the <hi>Year Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe Words cannot have a ſignification to enlarge the Eſtate granted, they ſerve only to explain what was intended to paſs; for in the Caſe at the Barr, if the Grant had béen <hi>totum &amp; quicquid habent in tenementis praedictis</hi> there would have been no queſtion of the Eſtate granted; but the Cogniſors having grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>tenementa praedicta,</hi> they ſeem by theſe ſubſequent Words to recollect themſelves, <hi>viz. totum &amp; quicquid habent in tenemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis praedictis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:172213:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected that the Limitation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, <hi>viz. durante vita eorum &amp; alterius eorum diutius viventis</hi> works a Diſſeiſin, becauſe by thoſe Words two Eſtates for Life paſs entire in poſſeſſion, whereas in truth there was but one Eſtate for Life of the Husband, in poſſeſſion; and therefore this was more than they could grant, becauſe the Eſtate Tayl came between the Eſtate which the Husband and Wife had for their Lives and for the Survivor of them, and the Eſtate which the Husband had for his own Life.</p>
               <p>And this is farther enforced by that Rule in Law, <hi>That Eſtates ſhall not paſs by fractions;</hi> for otherwiſe there can be no reaſon why they ſhould not thus paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this Rule is very fallible, and not ſo much to be regarded; 'tis true, the Rule is ſo far admitted to be true, where without inconveniency Eſtates may paſs without fraction; but where there is an inconveniency it may be diſpenſed withal, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an inconveniency as may appear to the Iudges to make the thing granted, to go contrary to the intent of the Parties.</p>
               <p>And that ſuch Interpretations have been made, agrees with the third Reaſon propoſed in this Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That it hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved countenance by judicial Opinions and determinations in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Iudgments, <hi>14 E. 4. 4. 27 H. 8. 13. 1 Co. 67. Bredons Caſe,</hi> which was thus; Tenant for life, remainder in tayl to <hi>A.</hi> remainder in tayl to <hi>B.</hi> Tenant for life, and he in the firſt remainder levied a Fine <hi>ſur cogniſance de droit come ceo;</hi> 't was adjudged that this was no <hi>Diſcontinuance</hi> of either of the Remainders,<note place="margin">1 Roll.

Car. 406.</note> becauſe each of them gave what he might lawfully, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tenant for Life granted his Eſtate, and the Remainder-man paſſed a Fee-ſimple determinable upon his Eſtate Tail, and yet each of their Eſtates were ſtill divided.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide it was ſaid, that in all Caſes where the perſon who hath a particular Eſtate, takes upon him either by Feoffment in <hi>pais</hi> or by Fine, which is a Feoffment on Record, to grant a greater Eſtate than he hath (as in this Caſe is done) though poſſibly the Eſtate of the Grantée may determin before that of the Grantor, yet 'tis a diſplacing the Reverſion; as if a Man has an Eſtate for ten Lives, and makes a Grant for the Life of another; here is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, that the Eſtate which he granted may be longer than the Eſtate he had in the thing granted, becauſe one Man may ſurvive the Ten, and for that reaſon 'tis a diveſting.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> In this Caſe the Eſtate which the Husband and Wife had is to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> What they granted.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:172213:63"/>
               <p>And by comparing of theſe together it will appear whether they granted more than they had: The Husband and Wife had an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for the Life of the Wife, and (after the Eſtate Tail) the Husband had an Eſtate for his own Life, now they grant an Eſtate for the Life of the Husband and Wife and the Survivor; What is this but one entire Eſtate in poſſeſſion? No other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation can be agréeable to the ſenſe of the Words; for if it had been granted according to the true Eſtate which each had, then it ſhould have been, firſt for the Life of the Wife, and after the Tail ſpent, then for the Life of the Husband.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered is, Whether the Eſtate ſhall paſs entire or by fractions? And as to that I need ſay no more than only to quote the Authority of that Iudgment given in <hi>Garret <hi>and</hi> Blizard's Caſe, 1 Roll. Abr. 855.</hi> which is ſhortly thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Tenant for Life, Remainder for Life, Remainder in Tail, Remainder in Fee to the Tenant for Life in Remainder; this Tenant for Life in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder levies a Fine <hi>come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> it was adjudged a Forfeiture of his Eſtate for Life; ſo that the Remainder Man in Tail might enter after the death of the Tenant for Life in poſſeſſion; for it ſhall not be intended that he paſſed his Eſtate by fractions, <hi>viz.</hi> an Eſtate in Remainder for Life and a Remainder in Feé expectant upon the Eſtate Tail, but one entire Eſtate in poſſeſſion; and 'tis not like the Authority in <hi>Bredon's Caſe,</hi> for there the Eſtate for Life and the Eſtate Tail followed one another.</p>
               <p>Next it is to be conſidered, whether after they granted <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia illa tenementa,</hi> the ſubſequent Words <hi>&amp; totum ſtatum ſuum, &amp;c.</hi> do not come in by way of Reſtriction, and qualifie what went before.</p>
               <p>But thoſe ſubſequent Words are placed in this Fine, not by way of Reſtriction but of Accumulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Litt. 345</note>In <hi>Littleton Sect. 613.</hi> 'tis ſaid, that if Tenant in Tail grants all his Eſtate in the Tenements, <hi>Habendum</hi> all his Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this Caſe the Alienee hath but an Eſtate for the Life of the Tenant in Tail; and 'tis obſervable that <hi>totum ſtatum</hi> in the Caſe put by <hi>Littleton</hi> is both in the Premiſſes and the <hi>Habendum:</hi> But if I will grant <hi>tenementa praedicta</hi> in the Premiſſes, and then make another Limitation in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> there <hi>totum ſtatum &amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, &amp;.</hi> can make no Reſtriction, if it ſhould, it will ſpoil moſt Conveyances.</p>
               <p>It is agréed, that if thoſe Words had béen omitted in this Caſe, then by this Fine the Reverſion would be diſplaced, and therefore much weight is laid upon theſe Words to explain the meaning of the Parties thereby, and that when they granted <hi>tenementa praedicta</hi> they meant <hi>totum ſtatum, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:172213:63"/>
               <p>But here is no ground for ſuch an Interpretation; 'tis an entire Grant of the Houſes by the Words <hi>Tenementa praedicta;</hi> and the ſubſequent Words ſhall never be allowed to make ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction which ſhall overthrow the frame of the Déed.</p>
               <p>If a Man, who has no Eſtate in the Land, paſſes it by Deéd, this ſhall work againſt him by way of Eſtoppel; and theſe Words <hi>totum &amp; quicquid, &amp;c.</hi> which are uſual in all Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, ſhall make no alteration of the Law; for if ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhould be made of theſe Words, as hath béen objected, then in all Déeds where they are inſerted, if it happen that the Party hath no Eſtate, or a void Eſtate, nothing paſſes; and then Covenants, Eſtoppels, and Warranties would be no Securities in the Law.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> Theſe Words <hi>totum &amp; quicquid, &amp;c.</hi> come in a diſtinct Clauſe of the Grant; the precedent Words are, <hi>Tenementa prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta &amp; totum ſtatum &amp; quicquid, &amp;c. reddiderunt,</hi> which are two parts, a Grant and a Releaſe, and have no dependance upon each other, being diſtinct Clauſes, and therefore theſe Words ſhall not be any Reſtriction of the former; but if one Clauſe be carried on with a connexion, ſo as 'tis but an entire ſentence; in ſuch Caſe a Man may reſtrain either general or particular Words, <hi>Hob. 171.</hi> in <hi>Stukely <hi>and</hi> Butler's Caſe.</hi>

                  <hi>3.</hi> Admitting theſe Words are a Reſtriction of the former, yet the Eſtate is ſo limited, that if the firſt Words were out of the Caſe, this later Clauſe he ſaid was enough for his purpoſe, for the Grant is not in the uſual Words by which Eſtates paſs, <hi>viz.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:172213:64"/> but they are reſtrictive only to the Eſtate of the Wife, and ſhall enure by way of Releaſe to <hi>A.</hi> ſo that after his death he in Reverſion may enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It would not be a Queſtion in that Caſe, whether theſe Words were reſtrictive or not, for nothing was granted but what might lawfully paſs, <hi>viz.</hi> during the Life of the Wife the other Ioyntenant; neither was there any ſtreſs laid on thoſe Words; for Mr. Iuſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> who was a Learned Man and reported the ſame Caſe <hi>fol. 55.</hi> hath made no mention thereof, but hath wholly omitted thoſe Words, which he would not have done, if the Caſe had depended upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. Object.</hi> Next, the Form of this Fine has been objected, and a Preſident was cited <hi>Raſt. Entr. 241.</hi> where ſuch a Fine was levied and nothing paſſed but for the Life of the Conuſor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But no Authority can be produced, where a Man that had an Eſtate for Life in Poſſeſſion and another in Remainder, and granted by the ſame Words, as in this Caſe, but that it was a Forfeiture.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. Object.</hi> That the Law will not make a Conſtruction to work a Wrong, and therefore if Tenant for Life grant generally for Life, it ſhall be interpreted during the Life of the Grantor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Caſe is without expreſs Words, or ſhewing any time for which the Grantee ſhall have the thing granted; and therefore the Law reſtrains it to the Life of the Grantor, becauſe it will not make Words which are doubtful and of incertain ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification to do any Wrong: But where there are expreſs Words as in this Caſe, no other Conſtruction can be made of them but that an Eſtate in poſſeſſion was thereby intended to paſs.</p>

                  <hi>4. Object.</hi> That this Fine and Grant muſt be conſtrued to enure according to the intent of the Parties, <hi>ut res magis valeat,</hi> and they never intended to make a Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Certainly no Man ever intended to make a Forfeiture of his own Eſtate, thoſe are generally the effects of Ignorance and not of the Will, as the Caſe of <hi>Gimlet <hi>and</hi> Sands, Cro. Car.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Roll. Abr. 856.</note> 
                  <hi>391.</hi> where Tenant in Fee makes a Feoffment to two to the uſe of himſelf for Life, then to the uſe of his Wife for Life, Remainder in Tail to his Son and Heir, Remainder to his own right Heirs; and afterwards he made another Feoffment to <hi>Smith</hi> with Warranty; the Mother and Son join in another Feoffment, adjudged that this was a Forfeiture of her Eſtate for life, though ſhe had no notice of the Warranty made by her Husband; for the Feoffment made by him was a publick Act upon the Land, and ſhe ought to have taken notice of it; and though by her joining in the Feoffment with her Son, ſhe did not intend to forfeit her
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:172213:64"/> Eſtate, yet the Law adjudges according to what is done: But in the Caſe at Barr, the intention of the Parties may be collected by the Act done; and there is great reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that the Parties thereby intended to diſplace the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; for the Husband joyning in the Fine, and in the Warranty (if it was no diveſting) the Warranty is of no uſe.</p>
               <p>Another Objection has been only mentioned, which is, that admitting this ſhould amount to a diſplacing, if the Eſtate had been in poſſeſſion; yet in this Caſe it would not, becauſe it was prevented by the Leaſe for years in being.</p>
               <p>But that cannot hinder the execution of this Fine; 'tis a Fine <hi>ſur conceſſit,</hi> which is executory in its nature, and doth not paſs any Eſtate, or take any effect 'till executed, and ſo is the Book, <hi>41 5. 3. 14. b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this Caſe the Fine was executed, which may be by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>pais,</hi> as well as by <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and as to this purpoſe, may be executed by the entry of the Conuſor,<note place="margin">1 Rep. 106. Dyer 376. b.</note> without ſuing out any Execution, <hi>38 Ed. 3. Brook tit. Scire facias 199.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there had been a Fine executed, there would have beén lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doubt left in this Caſe; and by the Attornment of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee for years, it muſt be admitted that this Fine was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as <hi>8 Ed. 3. f. 44.</hi> For a Fine of a Reverſion may be executed to all purpoſes by the Attornment of the Leſſee for years; and if ſo, when a Fine executory is once executed, 'tis as good as a Fine <hi>ſur Conuſance de droit come ceo,</hi> to make a forfeiture of the particular Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Where a Feoffment is made, and a Leaſe for years is in being, the Feoffment is not good; becauſe in ſuch caſe there muſt be a preſent tranſpoſition of the Eſtate,<note place="margin">Poſtea, Moor and Pitt.</note> which is hindred by the Leaſe.</p>
               <p>But in caſe of a Fine, which is a Feoffment upon Record, a Leaſe for years is no impediment or diſplacing of the Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if Tenant in Tayl, expectant upon a Leaſe for years, levy a Fine, 'tis a diſcontinuance of the Tayl, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Leaſe, the Fine has ſuch an operation upon the Free-hold, that it diſplaces the Reverſion in Fee, <hi>Co. Lit. 332.</hi> And therefore if a Leaſe for years prevents not a Diſcontinuance, it will much leſs hinder a diſplacing in this caſe.</p>
               <p>But no Iudgment was given now in this Caſe; another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being debated, whether the Plaintiff could have Iudgment, becauſe he was barred by the Statute of Limitations; for it did not appear that he had been in poſſeſſion for twenty years paſt, and

               <p>As 'tis an Inheritance transferrable, 'tis ſubject to the Rules of Law in point of Deſcent, and is demiſable for Life, in Fee, Tayl, Poſſeſſion or Reverſion, and in many things is common, and runs parallel with other Eſtates of Inheritance. 'Tis true, he cannot grant this Office for years, not for any diſability in the Grantor, but in reſpect of the matter and nature of the thing granted, it being an Office of Truſt and Perſonal, for otherwiſe it would go to the Executor, which is inconvenient, <hi>9 Co. 96. Sir George Reynell</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>To enquire what ſuperiority the reverſioner hath over the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Eſtate is not to the point in Queſtion; but there is ſuch an intimacy and privity between them, that in Iudgment of Law they are accounted as one Eſtate.</p>

               <p>This is a publick Office of great Truſt, and concerns the Adminiſtration of Iuſtice; and therefore 'tis but reaſonable to admit the Rule of <hi>Reſpondeat Superior,</hi> leſt the Party ſhould be without remedy; and the rather, becauſe Execution is the life of the Law, <hi>39 H. 6. 33.</hi>

               <p>In like manner, <hi>Duckenfield</hi> here is not a Deputy to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, but an immediate and proper Officer, and the habitual care and cuſtody is in him, which is enough to bring him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Rule of <hi>Reſpondeat Superior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Inſtances were given, becauſe this is not only a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im in <hi>England;</hi> but is of Foreign production, and adapted to the Rule of Common Law, <hi>Vide Bracton, Fleta, Selden.</hi>

               <p>The Statute <hi>de Scaccario 51 H. 3.</hi> Enacts, <hi>That if any man be received into Office in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> without the Treaſurer's Licence, or if he hath ſuch Licence, and doth Treſpaſs, he ſhall be puniſhed according to his Treſpaſs, if he have whereof, and if he have not, then he who put him in the Office ſhall be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and if he be not ſufficient his Superiour ſhall be charged; ſo that they ſhall all anſwer in their ſeveral Stations.</hi> And this Statute was made in affirmance of the Common Law; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Superiour of a Superior ſhould anſwer, why ſhall not the Defendant in this caſe anſwer for his ſubſtitute; for though the Warden is not ſworn to appoint one who is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſatisfie, he is bound to do it, and 'tis no argument to ſay that he is diſcharged, becauſe <hi>Duckenfield</hi> was appointed by the Court; for that is a work of ſupererrogation, which is left in the diſcretion of the Court, and may be done or omitted as they ſhall think neceſſary, but is not concluſive, <hi>39 H. 6. 34.</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince the Iury have not found that the Court took any examination whether he was ſufficient or not; but that he had forfeited his Office, having wilfully ſuffered a Priſoner to Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and then the Defendant is or may be the actual Officer, and having taken Security ought to be charged.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> who argued on the other ſide,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> before he ſpoke to the Caſe endeavoured to remove a doubt upon the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Verdict, which found that the Defendant had taken Security from <hi>Duckenfield</hi> to indempnifie him from Eſcapes.</p>
               <p>This ſays he might be an Argument at a <hi>Niſi Prius</hi> to induce a Iury to find Damages, but could not make a Man chargeable who was not ſo before.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> Though the Defendant had a Covenant from <hi>Duckenfield</hi> to pay <hi>1500 l. per annum</hi> to him, yet that will not make him more lyable than if nothing had been to be paid; neither did he lay any weight upon it, that the Defendant had any notice of the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of <hi>Duckenfield,</hi> for if he is chargeable he is bound to take notice at his peril; and no Body can believe that the Court of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> is chargeable, for that was mentioned in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Plaintiff, that the Superior of a Superior ſhall be charged where he is inſufficient; neither did he inſiſt upon the Rule in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> by which <hi>Duckenfield</hi> was admitted; but he conſidered,</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> If he could clear him from that Statute whether he was chargeable at the Common Law or by any other Statute.</p>
               <p>And he ſaid that he was not chargeable by the Statute of <hi>Weſtm. 2.</hi> which gives an Action of Debt againſt the Gaoler for an Eſcape: Many Authorities might be cited to prove that where a Man is in Execution on an Action of Debt, that ſuch an Execution is not within that Statute, <hi>7 H. 6. 5. Bro. tit. Eſcape pl. 9. Pl. Com. 35.</hi> It was doubtful there how a Gaoler became chargeable for the Eſcape of a Man who was in Execution for Debt; but were he in Execution for Matter of Accompt he is chargeable by the expreſs Words of the Statute, which are <hi>Caveat ſibi Vicecomes &amp; Cuſtos Gaolae;</hi> and the Parliament in <hi>1 R. 2.</hi> did not think the Warden chargeable, for if they did, to what purpoſe was it to make the Warden of the <hi>Fleet</hi> lyable to an Action of Debt for an Eſcape of a Man in Execution for Debt, if he was charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adle before by that Statute of <hi>Weſtm. 2;</hi> This was urged to ſhew that at that time it was not clear.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there are Authorities that ſeem another way, he did not affirm or deny it after ſuch varieties of Opinions, but procéeded to argue theſe two Points.</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> The Statute <hi>de Donis</hi> is by ſome called the Statute of great Men, becauſe the intent of it was for the preſervation of their Eſtates; and this Statute being made in the ſame<note n="*" place="margin">13 Ed. 1.</note> year ſeems alſo to have a particular regard to the Lord to give him a quick and more ſevere remedy againſt his Servant and Bayliff than he had before; for it makes him in effect his own Iudge againſt him in Caſes of Accompt, becauſe it gives him Authority to aſſign Auditors, and ſuch as he appoints muſt ſtand, and the Servant has no remedy but by Writ<note n="*" place="margin">F.

                  <hi>ex parte talis</hi> in the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer;</hi> yet no Man ever thought that by the Equity of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the ſame may be done in an Action of Debt, and therefore the difference in the Proceedings between Actions of Accompt and Debt ſeems to imply that an Action of Debt is not within the Rule of <hi>Reſpondeat Superior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> There is a great difference betweén the Reſtraint of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in Execution for Debt, and thoſe who are impriſoned by this Act for Arrear of Rent, which directs that they ſhall be arreſted <hi>&amp;c. &amp; carceri mancipentur in ferris;</hi> but this the Gaoler could not have done at the Common Law; neither was it ever practiſed or allowed by the Law that a Priſoner ſhould be ſo uſed, who is in Execution for Debt, unleſs he be unruly and endeavour to eſcape; but 'tis expreſly againſt the Law to do it where there is no ſuch reaſon, becauſe a Priſon is for the ſafe Cuſtody of Men and not to puniſh them, <hi>1 Inſt. 260. a.</hi> So that it appears by this that a ſtricter remedy was provided for Executions in Accompt than for thoſe in Debt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> There are certain perſons alſo who are made chargeable by this Statute when the Execution is in Accompt, who cannot be charged in Debt; for the Statute Enacts, <hi>That if the Party eſcape, the Officer in whoſe Cuſtody he is ſhall anſwer, <hi>ſive infra Libertatem ſive extra;</hi>
                  </hi> ſo that the Gaoler ſhall be charged whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be of a Franchiſe or of the County at large; but if a Man is in Execution for Debt, and then eſcapes, the Gaoler is not lyable, but the Sheriff; though the<note n="*" place="margin">3 Co. 71.

                  <hi>2.</hi> Point. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe he in Reverſion is not in propriety of Speech a Superior; for 'tis not ſaid that a Reverſioner after an Eſtate for Life is Superior and of more accompt in the Law than he who hath the particular Eſtate, but on the contrary he who hath the Fréehold is of greater accompt and regard in the Law than the Reverſioner after him; and if (as it hath been objected) both make but one Eſtate then there can be no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and it would be very hard and difficult for any Man to prove that any Attendancy is made by the Tenant for Life upon him who hath the Reverſion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Here is room enough within the Statute to ſatisfie that word <hi>Superior</hi> by a plain and clear conſtruction without bringing in the Reverſioner; for if the Sheriff makes a Deputy or a Lord makes Bayliff of a Liberty, the Sheriff and the Lord are properly the Superiors.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> This word <hi>Superior</hi> is uſed in the Statute made the ſame year with this <hi>cap. 2.</hi> in ſignification agreeable with the Caſe in queſtion; for it recites that where Lords of Fees diſtrain their Tenants for Rents and Services, and they having replevied their Cattle do alien or ſell them, ſo that a Return cannot be made; then it provides that the Sheriff or Bailiff ſhall take Pledges to proſecute the Suit before they make deliverance of the Diſtreſs, and if the Bayliff be not able to reſtore (that is, if he take inſufficient Pledges) the Superior ſhall anſwer, by which the Parliament could mean no other than the Lord of that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; for if it ſhould be otherwiſe there would be no end of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors; as if there is a Bailiwick in Fee of a Liberty, and the Bayliff thereof grants it for Life, in this Caſe there are two Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, for the Lord of the Bayliff is one, and the Bayliff himſelf is another, which cannot be, <hi>2 Inſt. 382.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Congruity in Law in ſaying the Sheriff and Lord are Superiors, but there can be none in making the Reverſioner a Superior.</p>
               <p>The Lord may loſe the Liberty if his Bayliff for Life or in Fee commit a Forfeiture, as by not attending the Iuſtices in Eyre; but a Reverſion cannot be loſt by the Forfeiture of the Tenant for Life; if the Bayliff make an ill Execution of a Writ or ſuffer the Party to eſcape, the Lord ſhall anſwer; ſo if the Marſhal of <hi>England</hi> appoint a Marſhal there may be a Forfeiture of his Office, becauſe 'tis but ſtill the ſame Office; and therefore the Caſe in <hi>Cro. Eliz. 386.</hi> where 'tis ſaid, <hi>If an Office be granted for Life, the Forfeiture of Tenant for Life ſhall be the Forfeiture of the whole Office,</hi> is miſtaken; for in <hi>Moor pl. 987.</hi> 'tis held other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and upon the true difference between a Deputy and a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:172213:69"/> Granteé for Life; for in the firſt Caſe there may be a Forfeiture of the Superior, becauſe 'tis ſtill but the ſame Office; but in the other Caſe the Superior ſhall not forfeit for any Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Grantée for Life, becauſe he hath the Freehold of the whole Office, and the other nothing but the Reverſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Defendant be liable in this Caſe 'tis in reſpect,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That he hath granted the Eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That he hath the Reverſion or Reſidue after the Life of the Grantee.</p>
               <p>He cannot be charged in reſpect that he hath granted the Eſtate, becauſe the Freehold is gone and in another; neither can he be charged in reſpect of the Reverſion, becauſe then not only his Heir but the Aſſigneé of the Reverſion will be chargeable alſo, which cannot be.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Point of this Argument; if the Defendant is not chargeable by this Statute he is not to be charged at the Common Law.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Sid. 306, 397.</note>
                  <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe the Common Law doth not give an Action of Debt for an Eſcape, but an Action on the Caſe only; neither doth it give any Remedy but againſt the Party offending.</p>
               <p>As to the Caſe that hath beén objected upon the Statute <hi>de Scac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cario,</hi> where the ſeveral Officers in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> ſhall anſwer in their degrées of Superiority, that cannot be applicable to this Caſe, becauſe there can be no proportion betweén things which concern the Kings Revenue and Prerogative, and thoſe of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon.</p>
               <p>The Caſes of the Coroner and the Sheriff, and of the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of a Receiver to the King are not like this Caſe, becauſe the King cannot inform himſelf of the ſufficiency of the Party recommended, and therefore 'tis but reaſonable that he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends ſhould be liable; and can it be ſaid that when the Defendant was about to ſell this Office to one <hi>Norwood</hi> (which he hath ſince done) that if a Stranger had recommended <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> and he had proved inſufficient, that the Stranger would have béen liable?</p>
               <p>As for the Civil Law and the Authorities therein cited to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern this Caſe, he did not anſwer them becauſe they judge after their Law, and the Common Lawyers after another way.</p>
               <p>This Office hath béen granted time out of mind for Life, and no doubt but many Eſcapes have been made, but never was any Action brought againſt him in the Reverſion before now.</p>
               <p>The Court of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> always examine the ſufficiency of the Grantee for Life, which ſhews that in all ſucceſſion of Ages the Opinions of Learned Men were, that no Eſcape could be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:172213:69"/> brought againſt the Reverſioner; for if ſo, what need is there of ſuch Examination? This was urged to ſhew that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of that Court did not alter, but interpret the Law.</p>
               <p>But admitting the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Norkfolk</hi> to be Law, yet it concerns not this, becauſe the Sub Marſhal there was taken as a Deputy, but there is no ſuch Officer as a Sub-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, for <hi>Duckenfield</hi> had it for Life.</p>
               <p>And then a Deputy being a perſon removable at pleaſure, will not be ſo conſidered in Law, as one who hath a more fixed Eſtate; for having nothing to loſe, it cannot be intended that he will be ſo careful in the execution of his Office, as the other; and therefore 'tis reaſonable in ſuch Caſe, that the Superiour ſhould anſwer: But he who hath a Freehold for Life, hath an Eſtate of ſome value in the Law, which he cannot be ſuppoſed eaſily to forfeit, and therefore 'tis reaſonable that he alone ſhould be lyable for his own Miſcarriages; for if the Defendant ſhould be charged, by the ſame reaſon the Grantee of the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be charged, who is altogether an innocent perſon, and ſo may be liable to a vaſt Sum for the Fault of another; for which Reaſons he prayed Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The Court delivered no Opinion this Term,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> but took time to adviſe; and afterwards in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term following <hi>Rainsford</hi> Chief Iuſtice delivered the Opinions of <hi>Twiſden, Wild</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> Iuſtices, who ſaid they were all agreéing in the main Point, but thought the Verdict imperfect, and not to warrant the Plaintiffs Caſe; for he declared that at the time when the Grant was made to <hi>Duckenfield,</hi> when the Commitment was, and when the Eſcape was ſuffered, and ever ſince, that <hi>Duckenfield</hi> was inſufficient and not able to anſwer the Plaintiff; but the Iury in the Special Verdict do not find the inſufficiency at that time when this Action was brought.</p>
               <p>But as to the main Queſtion they were of Opinion that the Defendant was Superior, and that he is chargeable for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of <hi>Duckenfield;</hi> but if he had béen ſufficient when the Plaintiff brought this Action, it might have been otherwiſe; but his Inability being fully averred in the Declaration; and the Defendant denying it, and the Iury having found nothing againſt it, but there being ſtrong Suſpicions of the truth of the Fact, the Court would not make an intendment to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Iury have found expreſly that <hi>Duckenfield</hi> was inſufficient at the time of the Eſcape, which was within ſix Weeks of the time when the Action was commenced; ſo that having once found him diſabled, unleſs it appear that he was of Ability after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:172213:70"/> the Court will not intend him ſo; but rather that he was inſufficient at the time of the Action brought; for there being ſtrong ſurmiſes of it, and there being no ground within the Record to intend him ſufficient, a Fact may be collected that is not found in the Verdict, <hi>Fulwoods Caſe, 4 Co.</hi>

                  <hi>2.</hi> As to the creation of Intails, there were no ſuch Eſtates at the Common Law; they were all Fee-ſimple Conditional, and <hi>poſt prolem ſuſcitatam</hi> the Condition was performed for three pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>

               <p>To Forfeit.</p>
               <p>Or to charge with a Rent; and thus the Law continued till <hi>13 E. 1.</hi> and there having been frequent Warrs between King <hi>John</hi> and the Barons, the great Men then obtained the Statute <hi>De donis</hi> to preſerve their Eſtates, leſt the like occaſion ſhould happen again; in which 'tis only mentioned, that the Tenant in Tail ſhould not have power to alien; but it was well known, that if he could not alien, he could not forfeit, for before that Statute, as he might alien <hi>poſt prolem ſuſcitatam,</hi> ſo the Iudges always conſtrued that he might forfeit, <hi>5 Edw. 3.14.</hi> for forfeiture
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:172213:72"/> and alienation did always go hand in hand, <hi>1 Co. 175. Mildmay</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>And from the making of that Statute, it always continued a ſetled and received Opinion, That Tenant in Tail could not alien, until by the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Ed. 4.</hi> a Recovery came in, by which the Eſtate Tail may be docked, and which is now become a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Then by the Statute of <hi>4 H. 7. cap. 24.</hi> Tenant in Tail might bar his Iſſue by Fine and Proclamation, and all this while it was not thought that ſuch Lands could be forfeited for Treaſon; which Opinion continued during all the Reign of <hi>H. 7.</hi> for though by his Marriage the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet the Great Men in thoſe days thought there might be ſome doubt about the Succeſſion, after the death of <hi>H. 7.</hi> if he ſhould dye without Iſſue, and thereby thoſe differences might be again revived, and therefore no endeavours were uſed to make any alteration in the Law, till after the death of <hi>H. 7.</hi> And after his Son <hi>H. 8.</hi> had Iſſue, thoſe doubts were removed, and being never likely to ariſe again, then the Act of <hi>26 H. 8.</hi> was made, which gives a Forfeiture of entailed Lands in caſes of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>The inference from this will be, that all the Caſes put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>26th</hi> year of <hi>H. 8.</hi> and ſo before entailed Lands were made forfeitable for Treaſon; and where by the <hi>general Words</hi> of Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, 'twas adjudged entailed Lands did not paſs, do not concern this Caſe; but now ſince they are made forfeitable by that Statute, ſuch general words are ſufficient to ſerve the turn.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of <hi>16 R. 2. cap. 5.</hi> entailed Lands are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited in a <hi>Praemunire</hi> but during the Life of Tenant in Tail; becauſe they were not then to be forfeited for Treaſon,<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 334. 1 Inſt. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Co. Lit. 130.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then it appears that the Crime of which Sir <hi>John Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> was guilty, was Treaſon; and if entailed Lands are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited for Treaſon, then when the Act ſaith, <hi>That he ſhall forfeit all his Lands;</hi> by thoſe general Words his entailed Lands ſhall be forfeited: And though by the Common Law there can be no Attainder in this Caſe, the Party being dead; yet by Act of Parliament that may be done, and the words in this Act amount to an Attainder.</p>
               <p>The intent of it was to forfeit Eſtates Tail, which may be collected from the general Words; for if a Fee-ſimple is forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though not named, why not an Eſtate Tail? eſpecially ſince the word <hi>Hereditaments</hi> is very comprehenſive, and may take in both thoſe Eſtates, <hi>Spelman</hi>'s <hi>Gloſſary 227. 2 Roll.

               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:172213:72"/>
               <p>In the very Act of <hi>26 H. 8. cap. 13.</hi> Eſtates Tail are not named, for the Words are, <hi>Every Offender convict of Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall forfeit all ſuch Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments which he ſhall have of any Eſtate of Inheritance, in uſe, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or by any Right, Title or Means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> and yet a Conſtruction hath been made thereupon in favour of the Crown; ſo a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an Earldom intailed is forfeitable by this Statute by the Word <hi>Hereditament, 7 Co. 34.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term <hi>Rainsford</hi> Chief Iuſtice delivered the Opinion of the Court,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> That upon Conſtruction of the Act of Pains and Penalties this Eſtate Tail was forfeited to the King.</p>
               <p>He agreed the Series and progreſs of Eſtates Tail to have been as argued by the Solicitor; and that the Queſtion now was whether by the Act of Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eſtates Tail can be forfeited unleſs there are expreſs Words to take away the force of the Statute <hi>de donis conditionalibus;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preface to 3 Co.</note> for by that Statute there was a ſettled perpetuity; Tenant in Tail could neither forfeit or alien his Eſtate, no not in Caſe of Treaſon, and Forfeiture is a kind of Alienation; but afterwards by the Reſolution in <hi>Ed. 4.</hi> an Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation by a Common Recovery was conſtrued to be out of the ſaid Statute, and by the Statute of Fines <hi>4 H. 7.</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by a ſubſequent Statute of <hi>32 H. 8. cap. 36.</hi> Tenant in Tail notwithſtanding his former reſtraint had power to alien the Eſtate Tail and barr his Iſſue; but all this while his Eſtate was not to be forfeited for Treaſon, till the Statute of <hi>33 H. 8. cap. 20.</hi> which gives <hi>Uſes, Rights, Entries, Conditions, as well as Poſſeſſions, Reverſions, Remainders, and all other things of a perſon attainted of Treaſon by the Common or Statute Law of the Realm to the King, as if ſuch Attainder had been by Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then by the Statute of <hi>5 &amp; 6 Ed. cap. 11.</hi> 'tis Enacted, <hi>That an Offender being guilty of High Treaſon and lawfully convict, ſhall forfeit to the King all ſuch Lands, Tenements and Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he ſhall have of any Eſtate of Inheritance in his own Right in Uſe or Poſſeſſion;</hi> by which Statutes, that <hi>de donis conditionalibus</hi> was taken off in Caſes of Treaſon, as it had been before by the reſolution in <hi>12 E. 4.</hi> and by the Statute of Fines, as to the Alienation of an Eſtate Tail by Fine and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
               <p>If therefore this Act of Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will admit of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as to make Eſtates Tail forfeit; here is a Crime great
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:172213:73"/> enough to deſerve ſuch a great puniſhment; a Crime for which the Parliament hath ordered an Anniverſary to be kept for ever with Faſting and Humiliation to implore that the Guilt of that innocent Blood then ſhed may not be required of our Poſterity; this they eſteemed as another kind of Original Sin, which unleſs thus expiated might extend not only <hi>ad Natos ſed qui naſcantur ab illis.</hi>

                  <hi>3.</hi> Becauſe the Offenders are dead; for had they béen living there might have been better reaſon to have conſtrued this Act not to extend to Eſtates Tail, becauſe then ſomething might be forfeited, <hi>viz.</hi> an Eſtate for Life; and therefore the Act would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie very little if ſuch Conſtruction could not be made of it to reach Eſtates Tail of ſuch perſons who were dead at the time of the making the Law, eſpecially ſince 'tis well known that when Men engage in ſuch Crimes they give what Protection they can to their Eſtates, and place them as far as they can out of danger.</p>

                  <hi>4.</hi> It appears by the Act that the Law-makers did not intend that the Children of ſuch Offenders ſhould have any benefit of their Eſtates, becauſe in the Proviſo there is a ſaving of all Eſtates of Purchaſers for Mony <hi>bona fide</hi> paid, and therein alſo a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Exception of the Wife and Children and Heirs of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; and if the Act would not protect the Eſtate of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren though they ſhould be Purchaſers for a valuable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will never protect their Eſtate under a voluntary Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made by the Anceſtor, eſpecially in this Caſe, becauſe the Entail carries a ſuſpicion with it that it was deſigned with a proſpect to commit this Crime; for Sir <hi>John Danvers</hi> was Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               <p>But the Anſwer is plain: For in the Reign of <hi>R. 2.</hi> when the Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> was made, Eſtates Tail were under a Perpetuity by the ſaid Statute <hi>de donis,</hi> which Statute is now much weakened in the Point of Alienation; and the Law is quite altered ſince that time; and 'tis apparent by multitude of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents that ſuch ſtrict Conſtructions have not been made ſince that time to preſerve Eſtates Tail from Forfeitures without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and particular Words;<note place="margin">4 Co. 164.</note> and therefore in the Caſe of <hi>Adams <hi>and</hi> Lambert,</hi> which is a Caſe in Point, the Iudges there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued Eſtates Tail to be forfeit for want of ſpecial Words in the Statute of <hi>1 E. 6. cap. 14.</hi> to ſave it; and that was only a Law made for ſuppreſſing of ſuperſtitious Vſes upon a politick conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but this is a much greater Offence intended to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by this Act, in which there are demonſtrations both from

               <p>The difference in <hi>Moor</hi> 867. is, if the Plea on which the Iſſue is joyned, hath no colourable pretence in it to barr the Plaintiff, or if it be againſt an expreſs Rule in the Law, there the Iſſue is immaterial, and ſo as if there was no Iſſue; and therefore 'tis

               <p>Then as to the point in Queſtion, he ſaid, that Toll cannot be appurtenant to a Mannor, and ſo the Pleading by a <hi>Que eſtate</hi> is not good; but if that ſhould be admitted, yet the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor being veſted in the Crown by the diſſolution, the Toll then became in groſs, and could never after be united to the Mannor, or appurtenant thereunto.</p>
               <p>But it was argued for the Defendant by <hi>Maynard</hi> Serjeant, and the whole Court were clear of Opinion, that the Iſſue was upon a particular point, and the Title was admitted, and that nothing remained in queſtion but the Point in pleading. And as to what had been objected, That Toll cannot belong to a Mannor, 'tis quite otherwiſe; for an Advowſon, a Rent, a Toll, or any Profit apprender may be appurtenant to it. Tis true a Man cannot preſcribe by a <hi>Que Eſtate</hi> of a Rent, Advowſon, Toll, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he may of a Mannor, to which theſe are appendant; 'tis likewiſe true, that if the Defendant had ſaid this was Toll for paſſing the Highway, he muſt ſhew ſome cauſe to entitle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the taking of it, as by doing ſomething of publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>But this general way of pleading is the moſt uſual, and ſo are the Preſidents, and it ought to come on the other ſide, and to be alledged, that the Defendant preſcribed for Toll in the High-way; and in this Caſe, though the Mannor came to the Crown, the Toll remained appurtenant ſtill, and ſo it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when it was granted out. The difference is between a thing which was originally a Flower of the Crown, and other things which are not, as <hi>Catalla Felonum, &amp;c.</hi> if ſuch come again to the King, they are merged in the Crown; but 'tis otherwiſe in caſes of a <hi>Leet, Park, Warren, Toll, &amp;c.</hi> which were firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King, <hi>9 Co.

               <p>This Caſe was argued by <hi>Saunders</hi> for the Plaintiff,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> and <hi>Levints</hi> for the Defendant. And firſt it was ſaid in behalf of the Plaintiff, that the Authorities in the Books were ſtrong on his ſide, that the firſt Adminiſtration was well granted; 'Tis true, if a Man make a Will, and Adminiſtration is granted, and that Will is afterwards proved, ſuch Adminiſtration is void, as in <hi>Greysbrook</hi> and <hi>Foxes Caſe, Pl. Com.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this Caſe, after the death of Sir <hi>David Cunningham</hi> the Executor, his Teſtator is dead Inteſtate; for to make an Executor there muſt be firſt the naming of him; then there muſt be ſome concurring act of his own to declare his aſſent, that he will take <hi>onus executionis</hi> upon him, for no man can make another Executor againſt his will; ſo that if after the death of the firſt Executor, thoſe other Executors appointed by him, had made ſuch a Declaration, as this ſurviving Executor hath ſince done, their Teſtator had dyed Inteſtate, <hi>7 E. 4. 12, 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Executor is made by the Teſtator, and the Ordinary is empowered by the Statute to make the Adminiſtrator where the perſon dies Inteſtate; ſo that 'tis plain there cannot be an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor and Adminiſtrator both together: If he who is made ſo taketh upon him long after the Will to be Executor, it ſhall make him ſuch by relation from the time of the death of the Teſtator; but here is no Executor nor ever was: 'Tis true, that one was named, but as ſoon as he heard of the Will he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and therefore there being no Executor in this Caſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now can hinder the Adminiſtration to be granted <hi>cum Teſtamento annexo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Teſtator ſhould dye indebted, or have Debts owing to him, and the Executor refuſes Probate, and renounces his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutorſhip, Adminiſtration muſt be granted, for <hi>Lex fingit ubi ſubſiſtit Aequitas,</hi> and the Executor having a poſſibility to be ſuch, and by his refuſal becoming no Executor, why ſhould the bare naming of him to be an Executor, have relation to make ſuch Adminiſtration void? ſince 'tis not the Name, but the doing of the Office which makes him Executor, <hi>Dyer 372.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all theſe Executors had dyed after Adminiſtration thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it cannot be ſaid that they ever were Executors.</p>
               <p>There can be no inconvenience that this Adminiſtration ſhould be good; for 'tis juſt that Creditors ſhould have their Debts, and Purchaſors ſhould be ſecure in the things purchaſed.</p>
               <p>If the Teſtator was indebted, an Action will lie againſt an Executor <hi>de ſon tort,</hi> for ſuch Debt, which Executor is altogether as wrongfull as the Adminiſtrator, to whom Adminiſtraton is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:172213:80"/> and the Will afterwards proved by the rightful Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and if ſuch Executor of his own wrong be poſſeſſed of a term for years, and a Creditor recovers againſt him, that Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor ſhall have the Term in ſatisfaction of his Debt; and by the ſame reaſon ſhall the Adminiſtrator here have a good title to this Term which he ſold for the payment of a juſt Debt, and there is no authority for making ſuch Adminiſtration void, unleſs it be where the Executor proves the Will, but never when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note>But on the other ſide it was ſaid, that an Executor of an Executor hath all the Intereſt which the firſt Executor had; ſo that being an Executor, the Adminiſtration ganted by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is void, and the renunciation afterwards ſhall never make it good; and this will appear by the different Intereſts which the Ordinary and the Executor have by Law.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Ordinary originally had nothing to do with the Eſtate of the Inteſtate, for<note n="*" place="margin">Godolph. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>bona inteſtati capi ſolent in manus Regis.</hi> Afterwards two Statutes were made, which eſtabliſh his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; the firſt was <hi>Weſtm. 1. cap. 19.</hi> and the other was <hi>31 E. 3. c. 11.</hi> Yet no power was thereby given him to diſpoſe of the Goods to his own uſe, or to the uſe of any other; he had only a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and not an abſolute and uncontroulable Right in the Eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> But the Executor hath a Right and Intereſt given to him by Law, when a Will is made, and may<note n="*" place="margin">5 Co. Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton's Caſe.</note> releaſe before probate; if he therefore hath an abſolute Right, and the Ordinary hath only a qualified property, how can he grant the Adminiſtration of the Goods, which at the ſame time are lawfully veſted in another? Suppoſe the Executor ſells ſuch Goods to one Man, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator to another,<note place="margin">2 Anderſ. 150. Caſe. 83.</note> the Sale of one of them muſt be void; and for the ſaid Reaſons, and by the conſtant courſe of the Law it muſt be the latter.</p>
               <p>It hath been objected, that here was no Executor at all, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one named; or if it be admitted that there was an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, yet his refuſal ſhall relate to the time of the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion committed, and make that good which might not be ſo before.</p>
               <p>But as to that, he ſaid that here was an Executor appointed by the Will, who had an Intereſt, and Adminiſtration being granted to another, 'tis void <hi>ab initio,</hi> and what is once void cannot be made good by any ſubſequent act,<note place="margin">Mod. Rep. 214.</note> 
                  <hi>10 Co. 62. a.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:172213:80"/>
               <p>Here was a want of power in him who did this Act; for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary could not grant Adminiſtration where there is an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and therefore no relation ſhall be to make that good which was once void; but if it had béen only voidable it might have been otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>A Relation may be to inable the Party to recover the Goods of the Inteſtate, and to puniſh Treſpaſſes; as if a Man die poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Goods, and a Stranger convert them, and afterwards Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration is granted to <hi>S.</hi> this Adminiſtration ſhall<note n="*" place="margin">2 Roll Abr. 399.</note> relate to the time of the death of the Inteſtate, ſo that he may maintain Trover, before the Ordinary had committed it to him, but it will never aid the Acts of the Parties to avoid them by Relation; as if a Man makes a Feoffment to a Feme Covert, and afterwards deviſes the ſame Land, the Husband diſagrées, this ſhall have relation between the Parties, ſo as the Husband ſhall not be charged in damages, but it ſhall not make the void Deviſe good, <hi>3 Co. 28. b. Butler <hi>and</hi> Baker's Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if a Man makes a Releaſe, and afterwards get Letters of Adminiſtration, that ſhall not relate to make his Releaſe good to barr him, neither ſhall his refuſal of the Executorſhip do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the time of the Releaſe or the refuſal there was not any right of Action in him; for that commences in the one Caſe after Adminiſtration, and in the other after the Probate of the Will.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding ſuch refuſal this Executor may afterwards adminiſter at his pleaſure,<note place="margin">Godolph. 141.</note> and intermeddle with the Goods of the Teſtator, and if the Adminiſtration ſhould be good alſo, then they would have a power over the ſame Eſtate by two Titles at the ſame time, which cannot be.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Argument which can be brought againſt this is <hi>ab inconvenienti,</hi> becauſe it cannot be ſafe to purchaſe under an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator, ſince a Will may be concealed for a time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the lawful Executor therein appointed may appear; but this is more proper for the Wisdom of a Parliament to redreſs than that the Law ſhould be altered by a judicial determination of the Court, and therefore he prayed Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The Court was of Opinion that the Ordinary cannot grant Adminiſtration where there is an Executor named in the Will,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> and therefore gave Iudgment for the Defendant againſt the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dée of this Term.</p>

               <p>This is a Civil Action brought by the Plaintiff for Words ſpoken of him, which if they are in their own nature actionable, the Iury ought to conſider the damage which the Party may ſuſtain; but if a particular Averment of ſpecial damages makes them actionable, then the Iury are only to conſider ſuch damages as are already ſuſtained, and not ſuch as may happen <hi>in futuro,</hi> becauſe for ſuch the Plaintiff may have a new Action: He ſaid that as a Iudge he could not tell what value to ſet upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

He did agrèe that where an unequal Tryal was, (as ſuch muſt be where there is any Practice with the Iury) in ſuch Caſe 'tis good reaſon to grant a new Tryal, but no ſuch thing appearing to him in this Caſe a new Tryal could not be granted.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:172213:82"/>
               <p>Suppoſe the Iury had given a ſcandalous Verdict for the Plaintiff, as a Penny Damages, he could not have obtained a new Trial in hopes to increaſe them, neither ſhall the Defendant in hopes to leſſen them; and therefore by the Opinion of theſe three Iuſtices a new Tryal was not granted.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in this Term Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> moved in Arreſt of Iudgment, and ſaid, that this Action was grounded upon the Statute of <hi>R. 2.</hi> Which conſiſts of a Preamble, reciting the Miſchief, and of the Enacting part in giving of a Remedy, and that the Defendants Caſe was neither within the Miſchief or the Remedy.</p>
               <p>This Statute doth not create any Action by way of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſign, and if the matter was now <hi>Res integra</hi> much might be ſaid that an Action for Damages will not lye upon this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; for the Statute of <hi>Weſtm. 2.</hi> appoints that the Offender ſhall ſuffer impriſonment, until he produces the Author of a falſe Report;<note place="margin">Ca. 33.</note> and the Statute of <hi>2 R. 2.</hi> which recites that of <hi>Weſtm. 2.</hi> gives the ſame puniſhment, and the Action is brought <hi>qui tam, &amp;c.</hi> and yet the Plaintiff only recovers for himſelf: It was uſual to puniſh Offenders in this kind in the <hi>Star Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> as in the * Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Caſe, where one <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> ſaid of him, <hi>That he wrote a Book againſt <hi>Garnet,</hi> and a Letter to <hi>Bellarmine;</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 Co. 132.</note> intimating, that what he wrote in the Book was not his Opinion, but only <hi>ad captandum populum,</hi> which was a great diſgrace to him in thoſe days, being as much as to ſay, he was a Papiſt, <hi>Cro. Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Serjeant would not inſiſt upon that now, ſince it hath been ruled that where a Statute prohibits the doing of a thing which if done might be prejudicial to another; in ſuch caſe he may have an Action upon that very Statute for his Damages.</p>
               <p>But the ground on which he argued was, that theſe words as ſpoken are not within the meaning of the Act, for they are not actionable.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe they are no ſcandal, and words which are actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable muſt import a great Scandal, which no circumſtance or occaſion of ſpeaking can excuſe; and if they are ſcandalous and capable of any mitigation by the precedent diſcourſe, the pleading of that matter will make them not actionable; and for this the Lord<note n="*" place="margin">4 Co.</note> 
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Caſe is a plain Authority, the Words ſpoken of him were, <hi>You like thoſe that maintain Sedition againſt the King's Perſon;</hi> the occaſion of ſpeaking of which was to give an account of his favouring the Puritan Preachers, which was all that was intended by the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; for that Lord had approved a Sermon which was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:172213:82"/> by a Parſon againſt the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> Book, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant having forbid ſuch Preaching, the Lord told him <hi>that he did not like him,</hi> upon which he ſpoke thoſe Words; ſo that the ſubject matter explained the ſenſe, for which reaſon it was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Action would not lie.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The ſcandal for which an Action may be brought within this Statute muſt be <hi>falſe,</hi> for that word goes quite through the whole Act, <hi>viz. falſe News, falſe Lyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> and the words here are ſo general, that it cannot appear whether they are true or falſe, for there can be no Iuſtification here; as in caſe where a Man is charged with a particular Crime, my Lord <hi>Townſend</hi> is not charged with any particular Act of Injuſtice as a Subject, nor with any Misdemeanour as a Peer, nor with any Offence in an Office.</p>
               <p>If therefore in all Actions brought upon this Statute the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may juſtifie and put the matter in Iſſue to try whether it be true or falſe; and in this Caſe the Defendant can neither ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie nor traverſe, for this reaſon the Action will not lie.</p>
               <p>That the Words are general and of a doubtful ſignification, it cannot be denied; for to ſay <hi>He is an unworthy Man</hi> imports no particular Crime; <hi>Unworthy</hi> is a term of Relation, as he is unworthy of my Friendſhip, Acquaintance or Kindred, and ſo may be applicable to any thing; and a Lord may in many things be unworthy of a particular Mans Friendſhip, as if he promiſes to pay a Sum of Mony at a day certain, and faileth in the payment, (as 'tis often ſeén,) ſuch is an unworthy Man, but that will not bear an Action: He is an unworthy Man who invites another to Dinner to affront him; but it will not bear an Action to ſay, <hi>That a Lord invited me to a Dinner to abuſe me;</hi> neither will it be actionable to ſay, <hi>He is an unworthy Man,</hi> becauſe ſuch inſtances may be given of his Vnworthineſs which will not bear an Action. If my Lord had beén compared to any baſe and unworthy thing, theſe Words might have béen actionable; and that was the Caſe of the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> it being ſaid of him, <hi>That there was no more value in him than in a Dog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then to ſay, <hi>A Man acts againſt Law,</hi> this is no Scandal, becauſe every Man who breaks a Penal Law, and ſuffers the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, is not guilty of any Crime. The Statute commands the burying in Woollen, the Party buries one of his Family in Linnen; in this he acts againſt the Law, but if the Penalty is ſatisfied, the Law is ſo likewiſe.</p>
               <p>A Man who acts againſt Law acts againſt Reaſon, becauſe <hi>Lex eſt ſumma ratio;</hi> but no inſtance is here given wherein he did thus act: 'Tis not ſaid, that he did act againſt Law wilfully, or that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:172213:83"/> he uſed to do any thing againſt Law; and ſo cannot be like the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who brought an Action for theſe Words, <hi>viz. You are uſed to do things againſt Law, and put Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into a Caſtle where they cannot be replevied;</hi> for there was not only an Vſage charged upon him, but a particular inſtance of Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>This Action lies for Words ſpoken of a Iudge of either Bench, and of a Biſhop, as well as of a Peer. Now if a Man ſhould ſay, <hi>A Judge acted againſt Law,</hi> will an Action lie? Becauſe a Iudge may do a thing againſt Law, and yet very juſtly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, unleſs all the Iudges were infallible, and could not be ſubject to any miſtakes, which none will deny.</p>
               <p>So if a Biſhop return the Cauſe of his Refuſal to admit a Clerk <hi>quia criminoſus,</hi> this is a Return againſt Law, becauſe 'tis too general; but if <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>A Biſhop acted againſt Law, and ſhew that for Cauſe,</hi> an Action would not lye. If the the Lord <hi>Townſend</hi> had commanded his Bayliff to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs without Cauſe, that had been acting againſt Law and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>He agreed the Words to be uncivil, but not actionable; for if ſuch Conſtruction ſhould be made, a Man muſt talk in Print, or otherwiſe not ſpeak any thing of a Peer for fear of an Action.</p>
               <p>There are many Authorities where a Péer ſhall not have an Action for every trivial and ſlight Expreſſion ſpoken of him.</p>
               <p>As to ſay of a Péer, <hi>He keeps none but Rogues and Raſcals about him like himſelf;</hi> by the Opinion of two Iuſtices, <hi>Yelverton</hi> and <hi>Flemming,</hi> the Action would not lie, becauſe they are Words of Scolding; and this was the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Lincoln, Cro. Jac. 196.</hi> But the Court was divided; the Defendant died, and ſo the Writ abated.</p>
               <p>Actions for Words have béen of late too much extended; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly there were not above two or three brought in many years; and if this Statute ſhould be much inlarged the Lords them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will be prejudiced thereby by maintaining Actions one againſt another.</p>
               <p>Vpon this Statute of <hi>2 R. 2 c. 5</hi> there was no Action brought till <hi>13 H. 7.</hi> which was above an hundred years after the making of that Law; and the occaſion of making the Law was, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who was then the firſt Prince of the Blood, took notice that divers were ſo hardy as to ſpeak of him ſeveral lying Words, <hi>1 R. 2. num. 56.</hi> and therefore this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was made to puniſh thoſe, who deviſed <hi>falſe News, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and falſe Lies of any Peer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby Diſcords might ariſe between the Lords and Commons, and great Peril and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:172213:83"/> to the Realm and quick Subverſion thereof:</hi> Now from the natural intent and conſtruction of theſe Words in the Act, can it be ſuppoſed that if one ſhould ſay, <hi>Such a Peer is an unworthy Man,</hi> that the Kingdom would be preſently in a flame and turned into a ſtate of confuſion and Civil War; and to ſay, <hi>That he acts againſt Law,</hi> that the Government would thereby be in danger to be loſt, and quick Subverſion would follow? This cannot be the common and ordinary underſtanding of theſe Words.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Plaintiff by ſpeaking theſe Words was in no hazard nor any wiſe damnified; if he was not touched in his Loyalty as a Péer, nor in danger of his Life as a Subject; if he was not thereby ſubjected to any Corporal or Pecuniary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; nor charged with any Breach of Oath, nor with a particular Miſcarriage in any Office; if the Words are ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that they import no Scandal, and are neither capable of any Iuſtification; and laſtly, if they are not ſuch horrible Lies as are intended to be puniſhed by the Statute; for theſe Reaſons he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Action would not lie, and therefore prayed, that the Iudgment might be arreſted.</p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Baldwin</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Barrel</hi> argued on the ſame ſide for the Defendant, but nothing was mentioned by them which is not fully inſiſted on in the Argument of Serjeant <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> for which Reaſon I have not reported their Arguments.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pemberton</hi> Serjeant, who argued for the Plaintiff, ſaid,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> that it would conduce much to the underſtanding of the Statute of <hi>2 R. 2. cap. 5.</hi> upon which this Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> was grounded, to conſider the occaſion of the making of it.</p>
               <p>In thoſe days the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were quite of another Nature and Genius from what they are at this time; the Conſtitution of this Kingdom was then Martial and given to Arms, the very Tenures were Military, and ſo were the Services as Knights Service, Caſtleguard and Eſcuage. There were many Caſtles of defence in thoſe days in the hands of private Men; their Sports and Paſtimes were ſuch as Tilts and Turnaments, and all their Imployments were tending to bréed them up in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who had any dependency upon Noble Men were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to Bows and Arrows, and to ſignalize themſelves in Valour it was the only way to Riches and Honour; Arts and Sciences had not got ſuch ground in the Kingdom as now; but the Commons had almoſt their dependance upon the Lords, whoſe Power then was exceéding great, and their Practices were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:172213:84"/> to their Power; and this is the true Reaſon why ſo few Actions were formerly brought for Scandals, becauſe when a Man was injured by Words he carved out his own Remedy by his Sword.</p>
               <p>There are many Statutes made againſt riding privately armed, which Men uſed in thoſe days, to repair themſelves of any Injury done unto them, for they had immediately recourſe to their Arms for that purpoſe, and ſeldom or never uſed to bring any Actions for damages.</p>
               <p>This was their Revenge; and having thus made themſelves Iudges in their own Caſes, it was reaſonable that they ſhould do themſelves Iuſtice with their own Weapons; but this Revenge did not uſually end in private Quarrels, they took Parties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their Friends, their Tenants and Servants on their ſides, and by ſuch means made great Factions in the Commonwealth, by reaſon whereof the whole Kingdom was often in a flame, and the Government as often in danger of being ſubverted; ſo that Laws were then made againſt wearing Liverys or Badges, and againſt riding armed.</p>
               <p>This was the miſchief of thoſe times; to prevent which this Statute of <hi>R. 2.</hi> was made, and therefore all provoking and vilifying Words, which were uſed before to exaſperate the Peers and to make them betake themſelves to Arms, by the intent of this Act are clearly forbidden, which was made chiefly to prevent ſuch conſequences; for it was to no purpoſe to make a Law and thereby to give a Péer an Action for ſuch Words as a common perſon might have before the making of the Statute; and for which the Peer himſelf had a Remedy alſo at the Common Law, and therefore needed not the help of this Act.</p>
               <p>If then the deſign of this Statute was to hinder ſuch practices as aforeſaid, the next thing to be conſidered is what was uſual in thoſe days to raiſe the Paſſions of Peers to that degreé, and that will appear to be not only ſuch things as imported a great Scandal in themſelves, or ſuch for which an Action lay at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, but even ſuch things as ſavoured of any Contempt of their perſons; and ſuch as brought them into diſgrace with the Commons, for hereby they took occaſion of Provocation and Revenge.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that very few Actions were brought upon this Statute in ſome conſiderable time after it was made, for though ſuch practices were thereby prohibited, the Lords did not preſently apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Remedy therein given, but continued the Military way of Revenge to which they had béen accuſtomed.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:172213:84"/>
               <p>As to the firſt Objection that hath been made, he gave no anſwer to it, becauſe it was not much inſiſted upon on the other ſide, whether an Action would lye upon this Statute, for the very words of it are ſufficient ground for an Action; and 'tis very well known that whereever an Act prohibits an evil thing,<note place="margin">Maxim.</note> the perſon againſt whom ſuch thing is done, may maintain an Action.</p>
               <p>This Statute conſiſts of two parts, the firſt is prohibitory,<note place="margin">Vide Ante.</note> 
                  <hi>Viz. That no Man ſhall do ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> Then comes the additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Clauſe, and ſaith <hi>That if he do he ſhall incur ſuch Penalty.</hi> 'Tis on the firſt part that this Action is grounded; and ſo it was in the Earl of <hi>Northampton's Caſe,</hi> in that Report which goes under the name of the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>12th.</hi> Report, where by the Reſolution of all the Iudges in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi> who was abſent; it was adjudged that it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that any particular Crime ſhould be fixed on the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, or any Offence for which he might be indicted.</p>
               <p>So are the Authorities in all the Caſes relating to this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the Lord<note n="*" place="margin">4 Co. 13. b. 2 Cro. 196.</note> 
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Caſe for theſe Words, <hi>You like thoſe who maintain Sedition.</hi> In the Lord of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>My Lord is a baſe Earl, and a paultry Lord, and keepeth none but Rogues and Raſcals like himſelf.</hi> In the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>He has no more Conſcience than a Dog.</hi> In the Lord<note n="*" place="margin">Hill. 16 Car. 2 Rot. 1269. Affirmed in a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in <hi>B R.</hi>
                  </note> Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>He is no more to be valued than the Black Dog which lies there.</hi> All which Words were held actionable, and yet they touch not the perſons in any thing concerning the Government, or charge them with any Crime, but in point of Dignity or Honour; And they were all vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying Words, and might give occaſion of Revenge.</p>
               <p>And ſo are the Words for which this Action is brought, they are rude, uncivil, and ill natured; <hi>Unworthy</hi> is as much as to ſay baſe and ignoble, a contemptible Perſon, and a Man of neither Honour or Merit. And thus to ſpeak of a Nobleman, is a Reflection upon the King, who is the Fountain of Honour, that gives it to ſuch perſons who are (in his Iudgment) deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by which they are made capable of adviſing him in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and it would be very diſhonourable to call unworthy Men thither.</p>
               <p>'Tis likewiſe a diſhonour to the Nobility to have ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fit among them as a Companion, and to the Commons to have their proceedings in Parliament tranſmitted to ſuch Peérs: ſo that it tends to the diſhonour of all Dignities, both of King, Lords and Commons, and thereby diſcords may ariſe between the two Houſes, which is the Miſchief intended to be remedied by this Act.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:172213:85"/>
               <p>Then the following Words are as ſcandalous; for to ſay <hi>A Man acts againſt Law and Reaſon,</hi> imports ſeveral ſuch acts done; a Man is not denominated to be unworthy by doing of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Act; for in theſe Words more is implied, than to ſay <hi>he hath done an unworthy thing;</hi> for the Words ſeem to relate to the Office which the Plaintiff had in the Country, as Lord Lieutenant, which is an Office of great Honour, and can any thing tend to cauſe more diſcord and diſturbance in the Kingdom, than to ſay of a great Officer, <hi>That he acts according to the dictates of his Will and Pleaſure?</hi> the conſequence of which is, that he will be rather ſcorned than obeyed.</p>
               <p>It hath been objected, that the Words are general, and charge him not with any act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scandal is the greater; for 'tis not ſo bad to ſay <hi>A Man did ſuch a particular thing againſt Law and Reaſon;</hi> as to ſay, <hi>He acts againſt Law;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, his conſtant courſe and practice is ſuch: And to ſay that the Words might be meant of breaking a Penal Law, that is a foreign Conſtruction; for the plain ſenſe is, he acts againſt the known Laws of the Kingdom, and his practice and deſigns are ſo to do, for he will be guided neither by Law or Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It has been objected that the Scandal muſt be falſe: But whether true or not, there can be no juſtification here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo general, that they cannot be put in Iſſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He agreed that no Action would lye upon this Statute if the words were true; but in ſome Caſes the divulging of a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal was an Offence at the Common Law; now to argue (as on the other ſide) that the Defendant cannot juſtifie, and therefore an Action will not lye, is a falſe Conſequence; becauſe words may be ſcandalous and derogatory to the dignity of a Peer, and yet the ſubject matter may not be put in Iſſue.</p>
               <p>He agreed alſo that occaſional Circumſtances may extenuate and excuſe the Words, though ill in themſelves; but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applied to the Caſe in queſtion, becauſe the Words were not mitigated: The Defendant pleaded Not Guilty, and inſiſted on his Innocence; the Iury have found him Guilty, which is an aggravation of his Crime; if he would have extenuated them by any occaſion upon which they were ſpoken, he ſhould have pleaded it ſpecially, or offered it in Evidence, neither of which was done.</p>
               <p>This Act is to be taken favourably for him againſt whom the Words are ſpoken; becauſe 'tis to prevent great Miſchiefs which may fall out in the Kingdom, by rude and uncivil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; and in ſuch Caſes 'tis uſual for Courts rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:172213:85"/> the remedy than to admit of any extenuation; for which reaſons he prayed that the Plantiff might have his Iudgment.</p>
               <p>It was argued by Serjeant <hi>Calthrop</hi> on the ſame ſide, and to the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>Afterwards this Term, all the Iudges argued this Caſe,<note place="margin">Argument at the Bench.</note> 
                  <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatim</hi> at the Bench. And firſt Iuſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> ſaid, That the greatneſs of the Damages given ſhould not prevail with him, either on the one ſide or the other; at the Common Law no Action would lye for ſuch Words, though ſpoken of a Peer, for ſuch Actions were not formerly much countenanced; but now ſince a Remedy is given by the Statute, Words ſhould not be conſtrued either in a rigid or mild ſenſe, but according to the genuine and natural meaning, and agreeable to the common underſtanding of all Men.</p>
               <p>At the Barr the ſtrained ſenſe for the Plaintiff is, that theſe Words import <hi>He is no Man of Honour;</hi> and for the Defendant, that they import <hi>no Scandal;</hi> and that no more was meant by them, but what may be ſaid of every Man.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, in reſpect of God Almighty, we are all Vnworthy, but the ſubſequent Clauſe explains what unworthineſs the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant intended, for he infers him to be <hi>Unworthy, becauſe he acts againſt Law and Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whether the Words thus explained fix any Crime on the Plaintiff, is next to be conſidered; and he was of Opinion that they did fix a Crime upon him; for to ſay <hi>He is an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Man,</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>He is a vitious perſon,</hi> and is the ſame as to call him <hi>a corrupt Man,</hi> which in the Caſe of a Peer is actionable; for general words are ſufficient to ſupport ſuch an Action, though not for a common perſon.</p>
               <p>To ſay, <hi>a Man acts againſt Law and Reaſon,</hi> is no Crime, if he do it ignorantly; and therefore if he had ſaid <hi>My Lord was a weak Man, for he acts againſt Law and Reaſon;</hi> ſuch words had not been actionable; but theſe Words as ſpoken do not relate to his Vnderſtanding, but to his Morals; they relate to him alſo as a Peer (though the contrary has been objected) that they relate to him only as a Man, which is too nice a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for to diſtinguiſh between a Man and his Peerage, is like the diſtinction between the perſon of the King, and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which hath been often exploded; the words affect him in all qualities, and all relations.</p>
               <p>It has been alſo objected, that the Words are too general; and like the Caſe of the Biſhops Return, that a Man is <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſus,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:172213:86"/> which is not good: But though they are general in the Caſe of a Peer, they are actionable; for to ſay of a Biſhop <hi>That he is a wicked Man,</hi> theſe are as general words, and yet an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will lye.</p>
               <p>It has been alſo objected, That general Words cannot be juſtified; but he was of another Opinion, as if the Plaintiff, who was Lord Lieutenant of the County, had laid an unequal charge upon a Man, who upon complaint made to him, ordered ſuch charge to ſtand, and that his will in ſuch caſe ſhould be a Law: If the perſon ſhould thereupon ſay <hi>That the Lord had done Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, and both againſt Law and Reaſon;</hi> thoſe words might have been juſtified, by ſhewing the ſpecial matter, either in Pleading or Evidence.</p>
               <p>'Tis too late now to examine whether an Action will lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Statute, that muſt be taken for granted, and therefore was not much inſiſted on by thoſe who argued for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, for the Authorities are very plain, that ſuch Actions have been allowed upon this Statute.</p>
               <p>The Words, as here laid to be ſpoken, are not ſo bad as the Defendant might ſpeak, but they are ſo bad that an Action will lye for them; and though they are general, yet many Caſes might be put of general words which import a Crime, and were adjudged actionable.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>He is an Oppreſſor:</hi> The Lord of <hi>Wincheſter's</hi> Caſe, <hi>He kept me in Priſon 'till I gave him a Releaſe;</hi> theſe words were held actionable, becauſe the plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from them is, <hi>That they were Oppreſſors:</hi> The Lord <hi>Abergavenny</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>He ſent for me and put me into Little Eaſe:</hi> It might be preſumed, that that Lord was a Iuſtice of Peace, as moſt Peers are in their Counties, and that what he did was by colour of his Authority; ſo are all the Caſes cited by thoſe who argued for the Plaintiff, in ſome of which the words were ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to import a Crime, and yet adjudged actionable; eſpecially in the Caſe of the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter, He is to be valued no more than a Dog,</hi> which are leſs ſlanderous Words than thoſe at the Bar, becauſe the ſlander is more direct and poſitive.</p>
               <p>It appears by all theſe Caſes, that the Iudges have always conſtrued in favour of theſe Actions, and this has been done in all probability to prevent thoſe dangers that otherwiſe might enſue if the Lords ſhould take revenge themſelves; for which reaſons he held the Action will lye.</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi> Then the parts of the Act are three, <hi>viz.</hi> reciting the Offence and the Miſchief, then mentioning the ill Effects, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Penalty.</p>
               <p>From whence he Obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That here was no new Offence made or declared; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was prohibited by this Statute, but what was ſo at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law before.</p>
               <p>The Offences to be puniſhed by this Act, are <hi>mala in ſe,</hi> and thoſe are Offences againſt the Moral Law; they muſt be ſuch in their nature, as bearing of falſe Witneſs; and theſe are Offences againſt a common Perſon, which he admitted to be aggravated by the eminency of the perſon againſt whom they were ſpoke; but every uncivil Word, or rude Expreſſion ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, even of a Great Man, will not bear an Action; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Action will not lie upon this Statute for every falſe Lye, but it muſt be horrible as well as falſe, and ſuch as were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable in the High Commiſſion Court, which were enormous Crimes, <hi>12 Co. 43.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this deſcription of the Offences, and the conſequences and effects thereof, he ſaid he could better judge whether the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:172213:87"/> Words were actionable or not; and he was of Opinion, that the Statute did not extend to Words of a ſmall and trivial nature, nor to all Words which were actionable, but only to ſuch which were of a greater magnitude, ſuch by which Diſcord might ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lords and Commons, to the great peril of the Realm, and ſuch which were great Slanders, and horrible Lies, which are words purpoſely put into this Statute, for the aggravation and diſtinction of the Crime; and therefore ſuch Words which are actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable at the Common Law, may not be ſo within this Statute, becauſe not horrible great Scandals.</p>
               <p>He did not deny, but that theſe were undecent and uncivil words, and very ill applied to that honourable perſon of whom they were ſpoken, but no body could think that they were horrible great ſlanders, or that any debate might ariſe between the Lords and Commons, by reaſon ſuch words were ſpoken of this Peer, or that it ſhould tend to the great peril of the Kingdom, and the quick deſtruction thereof, ſuch as theſe were not likely to be the effects and conſequences of theſe Words, and therefore could not be within the meaning of the Act, becauſe they do not agree with the diſcription given in it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Here is no new puniſhment inflicted on the Offender, for at the Common Law, any perſon for ſuch Offences as herein are deſcribed might have been Fined and Impriſoned, either upon Indictment or Information brought againſt him, and no other puniſhment is given here but Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Even at the Common Law ſcandal of a Peer might be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Pillory and loſs of Ears, <hi>5 Co. 125. De Libellis Famoſis, 12 Co. 37. 9 Co. 59. Lamb</hi>'s Caſe. So that it appears this was an Offence at the Common Law, but aggravated now, becauſe againſt an Act of Parliament, which is a poſitive Law; much like a Proclamation which is ſet forth to enforce the execution of a Law, by which the Offence is afterwards greater.</p>
               <p>He did agree, that an Action would lie upon this Statute, though there were no expreſs Words to give it to a Peer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where there is a Prohibition, and a Wrong and Damage ariſes to the Party, by doing the thing prohibited; in ſuch Caſe the Common Law doth intitle the Party to an Action, <hi>10 Co. 75. 12 Co. 100, 103.</hi> And ſuch was the Reſolution in the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Caſe, upon conſtruction of the Law as inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Statute; and as the Offence is greater becauſe of the Act, and as the Action will lie upon the Statute, ſo the Party injured may ſue in a <hi>qui tam,</hi> which he could not have done before the making this Law.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:172213:87"/>
                  <hi>3.</hi> But that ſuch words as theſe were not actionable at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, much leſs by the Statute; for the Defendant ſpoke only his Iudgment and Opinion, and doth not directly charge the Plaintiff with any thing, and might well be reſembled to ſuch Caſes as are in <hi>Rolls Abridgm. 1 part 57. pl 30.</hi> which is a little more ſolemn, becauſe adjudged upon a ſpecial Verdict; the Words were ſpoken of a Iuſtice of Peace, <hi>Thou art a Blood-Sucker, and not fit to live in a Commonwealth.</hi> Theſe were not held actionable, becauſe they neither relate to his Office, or fix any Crime upon him. <hi>Fol. 43.</hi> in the ſame Book, <hi>Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt to be hanged,</hi> not actionable, becauſe it was only his Opinion.</p>
               <p>So, where the Words are general without any particular Circumſtances, they make no impreſſion and gain no credit; and therefore in <hi>Cro. Car. 111. 1 Roll. Abridgm. 107. pl. 43. You are no true Subject to the King;</hi> the Action would not lie.</p>
               <p>In this Caſe 'tis ſaid, the Plaintiff <hi>acts againſt Law,</hi> which doth not imply a Habit in him ſo to do; and when Words may as well be taken in a mild, as in a ſevere Senſe, the Rule is <hi>quod in mitiori ſenſu accipienda ſunt.</hi> Now theſe Words are capable of ſuch a favourable conſtruction; for no more was ſaid of the Plaintiff, than what in ſome ſenſe may be ſaid of every perſon whatſoever; for who can boaſt of his Innocency? who keeps cloſe in all his actions to Law and Reaſon? and to ſay <hi>A Man acts againſt both,</hi> may imply that he departed from thoſe Rules in ſome particular Caſes, where it was the Error of his Iudgment only.</p>
               <p>In the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Sheppard's Abridgment 1 part, f. 28. Viz. You are uſed to do things againſt Law;</hi> and mentions a particular fact there indeed, becauſe of <hi>Uſage;</hi> of the ill practice it was held that an Action lies; but if he had been charged for doing a thing againſt Law but once, an Action would not lie.</p>
               <p>He then obſerved how the Caſes which have been adjudged upon this Statute, agree with the Rules he had inſiſted on in his Argument, which Caſes have not been many, and thoſe too of late times; in reſpect of the Antiquity of the Act, which was made almoſt <hi>300</hi> hundred years ſince, <hi>Anno 1379.</hi> and for <hi>120</hi> years after no Action was brought, the firſt that is Report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was <hi>13 H. 7. Keilway 26.</hi> So that we have no <hi>contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea expoſitio</hi> of the Statute to guide an Opinion, which would be a great help in this Caſe; becauſe they who make an Act beſt underſtand the meaning; but now the meaning muſt be
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:172213:88"/> collected from the Statute it ſelf, which is the beſt Expoſition, as the Rule is given in <hi>Bonham</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>8 Co. Vide</hi> the Caſe in <hi>13 H. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Caſe in time is the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>4 H 8. Cromp Jur. of Courts, f. 13. You have no more Conſcience than a Dog. Lord Abergavenny againſt Cartwright,</hi> in the ſame Book, <hi>You care not how you come by Goods;</hi> in both which Caſes the Words charge the Plaintiff with particular matter, and give a Narrative of ſomething of a falſe Story, and do not barely reſt upon an Opinion. <hi>In the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> his Caſe, Cro. Eliz. 1. Viz. You have writ to me that which is againſt the Word of God, and to the maintainance of Superſtition.</hi> Theſe were held actionable, becauſe they refer to his Function and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defame him, and yet he had but <hi>500</hi> Marks Damages. <hi>29 &amp; 30 Eliz. 1 Cro. 67. The Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> againſt <hi>Bridges,</hi> My Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> did know that <hi>Prude</hi> robbed <hi>Shotbolt,</hi> and bid me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with <hi>Shotbolt</hi> for the ſame, and ſaid, he would ſee me ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the ſame, though it coſt him an hundred pounds; which I did for him being my Maſter, otherwiſe the Evidence I could have given would have hanged <hi>Prude:</hi>
                  </hi> Theſe Words were held actionable and <hi>1000 l.</hi> Damages given; and in all the other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which have been mentioned upon this Statute, and where Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, the Words always charge him with ſome particular Fact, and are poſitive and certain, but where they are doubtful and general, and ſignifie only the Opinion of the Defendant, they are not actionable.</p>
               <p>The Words in the Caſe at Bar, neither relate to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff as a Peer, or a Lord Lieutenant, and charge him with no particular Crime; ſo that from the authority of all theſe Caſes he grounded his Opinion, that the Action would not lie; and he ſaid, If Laws ſhould be expounded to wrack People for Words, inſtead of remedying one Miſchief, many would be introduced, for in ſuch Caſe they would be made Snares for Men.</p>
               <p>The Law doth bear with the Infirmities of Men, as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Honour and Vertue doth in other Caſes; and amongſt all the excellent Qualities which Adorn the Nobility of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, none doth ſo much as forgiving of Injuries; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>That 'tis the Honour of a Man to paſs by an Infirmity.</hi> Which if the Plaintiff ſhould refuſe, yet the Defendant (if he thinks the Damages exceſſive) is not without his remedy by Attaint, for he ſaid he could ſhew where an Attaint was brought againſt a Iury for giving <hi>60 l.</hi> Damages.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:172213:88"/>
               <p>He farther ſaid, that he could not find that any Iudgment had been either reverſed or arreſted upon this Statute, and therefore it was fit that the Law ſhould be ſetled by ſome Rule, becauſe 'tis a wretched condition for People to live under ſuch Circumſtances, as not to know how to demean themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Péer; and ſince no Limits have been hitherto preſcribed 'tis fit there ſhould be ſome now, and that the Court ſhould go by the ſame Rules in the Caſe of a Peer, as in that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, that is, not to conſtrue the Words actionable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome particular Crime charged upon the Plaintiff, or unleſs he alledge ſpecial damages; for which Reaſons he held that this Action would not lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyndham</hi> Iuſtice accorded with <hi>Scroggs;</hi> and the Chief Iuſtice <hi>North</hi> agreed with them in the ſame Opinion; his Argument was, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaid that he did not wonder that the Defendant made his Caſe ſo ſolemn, being loaded with ſo great damages; but that his Opinion ſhould not be guided with that or with any Rules, but thoſe of Law, becauſe this did not concern the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff alone, but was the Caſe of all the Nobility of <hi>England;</hi> but let it be never ſo general, and the Conveniences or Incoveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences never ſo great, he would not upon any ſuch conſiderations alter the Law.</p>
               <p>He ſaid that no Action would lie upon this Statute, which would not lie at the Common Law; for where a Statute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits a thing generally, and no particular Man is concerned, an Offence againſt ſuch a Law is puniſhable by Indictment; but where there is a particular damage to any perſon by doing the thing prohibited, there an Action will lie upon the Statute, and ſo it will at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>The Words therefore which are actionable upon this Statute are ſo at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>This Statute extends only to Peers or other great Officers; now every Peer as ſuch is a great Officer, he has an Office of great Dignity, he is to ſupport the King by his advice, of which he is made capable by the great Eminency of his Reputation, and therefore all Words which reflect upon him as he is the Kings Councellor, or as he is a Man of Honour and Dignity, are action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>In the ordinary Caſes of Officers 'tis not neceſſary to ſay that the Words were ſpoken relating to his Office, as to ſay of a Lawyer that <hi>He is a Sot or an Ignoramus;</hi> or of a Tradeſman, <hi>He is a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:172213:89"/> Bankrupt,</hi> the Action lies though the Words were not ſpoken of either as a Lawyer or Tradeſman.</p>
               <p>He did not think that Iudges were to teach Men by what Rules to walk other than what did relate to the particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before them, all other things are <hi>gratis dicta;</hi> neither would he allow that diſtinction, that an Action would not lie where a Man ſpoke only his Opinion; for if that ſhould be admitted, it would be very eaſie to ſcandalize any Man, as <hi>I think ſuch a Judge is corrupt,</hi> or <hi>I am of Opinion that ſuch a Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor is a Traytor;</hi> and can any Man doubt whether theſe or ſuch like Words are actionable or not, becauſe ſpoken only in the ſenſe of the perſon? 'Tis true, in ſome Caſes where a Man ſpeaks his own particular diſeſteem an Action will not lie, as if I ſay, <hi>I care not for ſuch a Lord,</hi> but that differs much where a Man ſpeaks his Opinion with reference to a Crime; for Opinions will be ſpread, and will have an implicit Faith, and becauſe one Man believes it another will; and 'tis upon this ground that all the Caſes which have been ſince the Statute are juſtified; and ſo was the late Caſe of<note n="*" place="margin">Sid. 233.</note> the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorcheſter, He is no more to be valued than the Black Dog which lies there</hi> which were Words of diſeſteem, and only the Opinion of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, in which Caſe Iudgment was affirmed in a Writ of Error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it be objected to what purpoſe this Statute was made if no Action lies upon it, but what lay at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Plaintiff now upon the Statute muſt proſecute <hi>tam pro Domino Rege quam pro ſeipſo,</hi> which he could not do at the Common Law. And it has beén held in the <hi>Starr-Chamber</hi> that if a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> be brought upon this Statute the Defendant cannot juſtifie, becauſe 'tis brought <hi>qui tam, &amp;c.</hi> and the King is concerned; but the Defendant may explain the Words and tell the occaſion of ſpeaking of them, if they are true, they muſt not be publiſhed becauſe the Statute was to prevent Diſcords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Theſe Words carry in them no diſeſteem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> According to a Common Vnderſtanding they are Words of diſreſpect and of great diſeſteem; for 'tis as much as to ſay, that the Plaintiff is a Man of no Honour; he is one who lives after his own Will, and ſo is not fit to be employed under the King; if any precedent diſcourſe had qualified the ſpeaking theſe Words it ought to have been ſhewn by the Defendant, which is not done, and therefore he concluded that the Words notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:172213:89"/> what was objected were actionable; and ſo by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, <hi>Wyndham</hi> and <hi>Scroggs</hi> Iuſtices, Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> for the Defendant ſaid, that there is a difference when Letters of Adminiſtration are granted in caſe the Party die inteſtate, and when a Man makes a Will and therein appoints an Executor, for in that Caſe the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor comes in immediately from the death of the Teſtator; but when a Man dies inteſtate the Ordinary hath an Intereſt in the Goods, and therefore he who takes them is <hi>Executor de ſon tort,</hi> and may be charged as ſuch; but 'tis otherwiſe generally, where there is a Will and a rightful Executor, who proveth the ſame, for he may bring a Trover againſt the Party for taking of the Teſtators Goods though he never had the actual poſſeſſion of them; and therefore the taking in ſuch caſe will not make a Man <hi>Executor de ſon tort,</hi> becauſe there is another lawful Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor; but 'tis true, that if there be a ſpecial Adminiſtration 'tis otherwiſe; as if a Stranger doth take upon him to pay Debts or Legacies; or to uſe the Inteſtates Goods; ſuch an expreſs Adminiſtration will make him <hi>Executor de ſon tort,</hi> and liable, as in <hi>Read's Caſe, 5 Co.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in this Caſe the Defendant pleads that <hi>J. S.</hi> was Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which <hi>prima facie</hi> diſcharges him; for to make him chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Plaintiff ought in his Replication to ſet forth the ſpecial Adminiſtration, that though there was an Executor, yet before he aſſumed the Execution or proved the Will, the Defendant firſt took the Goods, by which he became Executor of his own Wrong, and ſo to have brought himſelf within this diſtinction, (which was the truth of this Caſe) and that would have put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of diſpute, which not being done, he held the Plea to be good; and ſo prayed Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:172213:90"/>
               <p>The Court were of Opinion that <hi>prima facie</hi> this was a good Plea; for where a Man<note n="*" place="margin">2 Sand. 28.</note> confeſſes and avoids, he need not traverſe, and here the Defendant had avoided his being chargeable as <hi>Executor de ſon tort,</hi> by ſaying that there was a rightful Executor who had adminiſtred the Teſtators whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; but the Surmiſe of the Plaintiff and the Plea of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant being both in the<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cro. 579. pl. 9. Sid. 341. 1 Sand. 338.</note> affirmative no Iſſue can be joined thereon; and therefore the Defendant ought to have traverſed that he was Executor, or ever adminiſtred as Executor, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe his Plea gives no full Anſwer to the Charge in the Declaration, being charged as Executor, who pleads that another was Executor, and both theſe matters might be true, and yet the Defendant liable as <hi>Executor de ſon tort,</hi> which (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Iniquum non eſt praeſumendum</hi>) may be well intended here; and ſo Iudgment was given againſt the Defendant that this was no good Plea.</p>

               <p>In which Caſe theſe Points were reſolved by the Court.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Mod. Rep. 211.</note>1. If there be an Agreement before Marriage that the Wife may make a Will, if ſhe do ſo, 'tis a good Will, unleſs the Husband diſagreés; and his Conſent ſhall be implyed till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appear. And the Law is the ſame though he knew not when ſhe made the Will, which when made 'tis in this Caſe, as in others, ambulatory till the death of the Wife, and his diſſent thereunto; but if after her death he doth conſent he can never afterwards diſſent, for then he might do it backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>in infinitum.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. If the Husband would not have ſuch Will to ſtand he ought preſently after the death of the Wife to ſhew his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Husband conſent that his Wife ſhall make a Will, and accordingly ſhe doth make ſuch a Will and dieth, and if after her death he comes to the Executor named in the Will, and ſeems to approve her choice, by ſaying, <hi>He is glad that ſhe had appointed ſo worthy a Perſon,</hi> and ſeemed to be ſatisfied in the main with the Will, and recommended a Coffin-maker to the Executor, and a Goldſmith for making the Rings, and a Herald Painter for making the Eſcutcheons, this is a good aſſent and makes it a good Will, though the Husband when he ſees and reads the Will (being thereat diſpleaſed) oppoſes the Probate in the Spiritual Court by entring Caveats and the like; and ſuch diſagreément after the former aſſent will not hurt the Will, becauſe ſuch aſſent is good in Law, though he know not the particular Bequeſts in the Will.</p>

               <p>And he ſaid that in all Courts of Equity the uſual courſe was; when a Bill is exhibited to have Mony decreed due on a Bond up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Suggeſtion that the Bond is loſt; there muſt be Oath made of it, for otherwiſe the Cauſe is properly triable at the Common Law; and ſuch courſe is to be obſerved in all the like Caſes, where the Plaintiff by ſurmiſe of the loſs of a Déed draws the Defendant into Equity; but if the Caſe be proper in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a Court of Conſcience, and in caſe where the Déed is not loſt, the Remedy deſired in <hi>Chancery</hi> could not be obtained upon a Trial at Law, there though it be alledged that the Déed is loſt, Oath need not be made of it; as if there be a Déed in which there is a Covenant for farther Aſſurance, and the Party comes in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and prays the thing to be done in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> there is no need of an Oath of the loſs of ſuch Deed, becauſe if it 'tis not loſt the Party could not at Law have the thing for which he prayed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, for he could only recover Damages.</p>

               <p>Serjeant <hi>Baldwyn,</hi> who argued for the Plaintiff, held that it did lie, for though the Rent in this Caſe reſerved did not attend the Reverſion, becauſe the Leſſee had aſſigned over all his Term, yet an Action of Debt will lie for that Rent upon the Contract, <hi>Cro.

               <p>If then here is a good Rent reſerved, the Wife who receives the Profits, becomes Executrix <hi>de ſon tort,</hi> and ſo is lyable to the payment.</p>
               <p>It hath been held there cannot be an Executor <hi>de ſon tort</hi> of a Term, but the Modern Opinions are otherwiſe; as it was held in the Caſe of <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Sweetman, Trin. 1653.</hi> in <hi>B. R.</hi> And
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:172213:93"/> that an Action of Debt will lie againſt him.

               <p>But if one enter as Executor <hi>de ſon tort,</hi> and ſell Goods, the Sale is good; which was not ſo in this Caſe, becauſe there was a Term in Reverſion, whereof no Entry could be made, for which reaſon there could be no Executor <hi>de ſon tort</hi> to that, and therefore the Sale to <hi>Burgeſs</hi> before the Adminiſtration, was held void.</p>
               <p>And that there may be an Executor <hi>de ſon tort</hi> of a Term, there was a late Caſe adjudged in <hi>Trin. 22 Car. 2.</hi> between <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> and <hi>Carr,</hi> which was, Leſſee for years rendring Rent dies Inteſtate, his Wife takes out Letters of Adminiſtration, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Marries a ſecond Husband, the Wife dies, and the Husband continues in Poſſeſſion and receives the Profits: It was agreed, that for the Profits received he was anſwerable as Executor <hi>de ſon tort,</hi> and the Book of <hi>10 H. 11.</hi> was cited as an authority to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pemberton</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> would not undertake to anſwer theſe Points which were argued on the other ſide, but admitted them to be plain againſt him, for he did not doubt but that Debt would lie upon the Contract, where the whole Term was aſſigned, and that there may be an Executor <hi>de ſon tort</hi> of a Term; but he ſaid, that which was the principal point in the Caſe was not ſtirred: The queſtion was, whether an Action of Debt will lie againſt the Defendant as Executor <hi>de ſon tort</hi> where there is no Term at all; for 'tis plain there was none in being in this Caſe, becauſe when the Leſſee Re-demiſed his whole Term to the Leſſor, that was a Surrender in Law, and as fully as if it had been actually ſurrendred; and therefore this was quite different from the Caſe, where Leſſee for years makes an Aſſignment of his whole Term to a Stranger, Debt will lie upon the Contract there, becauſe an Intereſt paſſes to him in Reverſion, and as to this purpoſe a Term is <hi>in eſſe</hi> by the Contract of the Parties, and ſo it would here againſt the firſt Leſſor, who was Leſſee upon the Re-demiſe; but now becauſe of the Surrender, the Heir is intituled to enter, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:172213:94"/> who is the Defendant, enters in his Right as Guardian, which ſhe may lawfully do.</p>
               <p>If therefore Debt only lies upon the Contract of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as in truth it doth where the whole Term is gone, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff cannot charge any one as Executor <hi>de ſon tort</hi> in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the whole Term is gon here by the Re-demiſe, which is an abſolute Surrender, and not upon Condition, for in ſuch Caſe the Surrenderor might have entred for non-performance, and ſo it might have been revived: And of this Opinion was the whole Court in both points, and would not hear any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument in the Caſe; the Plaintiff having no remedy at Law, the Court told him that he might ſeek for relief in <hi>Chancery,</hi> if he thought fit.</p>

               <p>This Caſe was argued this Term by Serjeant <hi>Skipwith</hi> and <hi>Baldwyn</hi> for the Defendant, and by Serjeant <hi>Barrel</hi> and <hi>George Strode</hi> for the Plaintiff; and in their Arguments for the Defendant it was ſaid,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def. Sid. 23. 2 Sand. 60. Cro. Eliz. 624.</note> That the Plaintiff in this caſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain an Action of Eſcape, for where the Sheriff takes Bail, no Eſcape will lie againſt him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he is compellable by the Statute to let the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to Bail.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he have not the Defendant ready at the return of the Writ, he may be amerced, which is the proper remedy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This precept of letting the Defendant to Bail, being by Act of Parliament, is intended by the direction of the Plaintiff himſelf, becauſe all people are Parties to the making of an Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Many Actions have been brought againſt Sheriffs, upon Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions that no Bail have been taken,<note place="margin">Antea, Page and Tulſe.</note> and for which an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Caſe will lie; but where there is Bail taken, the Sheriff hath done his duty which he is commanded to do by the Statute; and if the Defendant doth not appear, the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff is to be amerced, and he is the proper Iudge of the Bail; the Plaintiff is no ways concerned therein whether good or bad.</p>
               <p>At the Common Law the Defendant was to continue in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon till he had ſatisfied the Plaintiff, to whom no benefit was intended by this Statute, but rather an eaſe to the Defendant, that he ſhould be from thence diſcharged, giving good Bail; and the reaſon why the Statute mentions ſuch Bail is in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Sheriff alſo,<note place="margin">Cro Eliz. 672.</note> to ſecure him from Amerciaments; the Bail being then for his Indempnity, he is the ſole Iudge both of their perſons, number, and ability, for the Statute requires two Sureties, and that they ſhall be Men within the County; yet if there is but one, and he not of the County, and if the Bond taken by the Sheriff for the appearance of the Defendant be but 40 <hi>l.</hi> and the Debt due to the Plaintiff be 400 <hi>l.</hi> 'tis well enough,<note place="margin">2 Cro. 286.</note> becauſe the Statute doth not reſtrain him to any Sum or Sureties, for he may take what Sum he pleaſe to force the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to appear.</p>
               <p>And when this Security is taken, the Sheriff is neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to aſſign it to the Plaintiff, or he to take it. Tis true, he doth uſually aſſign it, but that is to diſcharge himſelf of the Amerciaments, which is the way that the Plaintiff ſhould purſue where he doth imagine the Bail to be inſufficient.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:172213:95"/>
               <p>If therefore this Statute was made for the benefit and eaſe of the Defendant, the Security therein directed is for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity of the Sheriff; and therefore if no Action will lie againſt him for taking of inſufficient Bail, 'tis as reaſonable that no Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould lie againſt him when he hath taken Bail, which he is compelled to do, and ſo the Traverſe in this Caſe is immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and Iudgment ought to be given for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide it was argued,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> That an Action of Eſcape would lye againſt the Sheriff, if he did not take good Bail, which matter may be traverſed; and though here if the Defendant had rejoyned, the Iſſue had been, whether ſufficient Bail within the County or not, yet that part of the Iſſue had not been material, for the only matter had reſted upon the ſufficiency or inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Bail in general. Like a Caſe adjudged in <hi>Mich.</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>in B. R.</hi> where a Woman had power given her by her Husband to make a Will in the preſence of two credible Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: It was pleaded that ſhe made a Will in the preſence of <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> credible Witneſſes, and Iſſue was thereupon joyned,<note place="margin">Antea.</note> and it was found to be made in the preſence of <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> who were credible Witneſſes, and this was held to be good, becauſe the ſubſtance was found, <hi>Viz.</hi> That it was made in the preſence of two credible Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>The Defendant therefore here ought to have taken good and ſufficient Bail to bring himſelf within the Statute, and that is traverſable, and the Pleadings are well enough, for if there be good Bail, 'tis not material in what County they live.</p>
               <p>Vpon the firſt Argument of this Caſe, the Lord Chief Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice inclined that an Action of Eſcape did lie at the Common Law againſt the Sheriff; for it was clear that he was to keep the Party arreſted in Priſon 'till the Debt was ſatisfied, and that if he had gone at large, it had been an Eſcape; the Sheriff then hath no excuſe but by this Statute, and to entitle himſelf to any benefit thereby, he muſt purſue the very directions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in preſcribed, and therefore ought to take good and ſufficient Bail, for otherwiſe the Statute would be eluded, if it be left in his power to take what Bail he pleaſes; and he was of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Plaintiff had an Intereſt in the Security, and therefore the Sheriff was lyable, if it was not good when firſt taken, but not if by any accident afterwards the Bail miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or become inſolvent.</p>
               <p>And Iuſtice <hi>Wyndham</hi> was of the ſame Opinion, that the Sheriff was lyable; he differed only as to the manner of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:172213:96"/> Action, which he held ſhould be a ſpecial Action on the Caſe, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the whole matter, and alledging that the Defendant did not take ſufficient Bail.</p>
               <p>Iuſtice <hi>Atkyns</hi> ſaid, the Caſe depends upon the conſtruction of that<note n="*" place="margin">23 H. 6. cap. 10.</note> Statute, which is very obſcure, and the Opinions vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous which have been upon it; 'tis plain the Sheriff is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to take Bail, and that an Action lies againſt him if he refuſes ſuch as are ſufficient when tendred; but the queſtion was now whether it will lie againſt him fortaking thoſe who are inſufficient; and as to that he ſaid that many Authorities were in our Books, that the taking of Bail is left to the Sheriffs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and he is thereby to provide for his own indempnity; for he muſt return a <hi>Cepi Corpus</hi> upon the Writ, he cannot return that he let him to Bail according to the Statute, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inclined that the Action did not lie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scroggs</hi> Iuſtice <hi>contra.</hi> He ſaid that this Statute deſigned the benefit of the Creditor, that he might either get the Sheriff amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or have an Action, in both which Caſes he might indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf by the Security he had taken. Tis true, he may let the Party to Bail, but 'tis <hi>ſub modo,</hi> it muſt be upon good Bail; and if the Sheriff be Iudge of the Security, 'tis an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that he is lyable, for if he was not in danger, he need not take Security.</p>
               <p>But afterwards upon the ſecond Argument, the Chief Iuſtice and the whole Court were of Opinion, that Iudgment ſhould be given for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iuſtice. The Common Law was very rigorous as to the execution of Proceſs; the <hi>Capias</hi> was <hi>ita quod habeas</hi> the Body at the day of the Return, and if the Sheriff had arreſted one, it had been an Eſcape to let him go. Before the making of this Statute the Sheriff uſually took Sureties for the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Priſoner, and by this means uſed great Extortion and took great Sums of Mony; to prevent which Miſchiefs this Statute was made and ſo deſigned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the eaſe of the Priſoner, the Sheriff being now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to take Security, which he was not obliged to do before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prevent Extortion, and therefore directs that a Bond ſhall be taken in ſuch manner and with ſuch conditions as is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned.</p>
               <p>But the Plaintiff ſince the Statute is much in the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:172213:96"/> as before, for he is to make the ſame Return of <hi>Cepi Corpus:</hi> 'Tis true, he may now let him go upon Bail, but as to the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor he is to have him in Court to anſwer his Suit as before, and ſhall be amerced if he doth not appear at the Return of the Writ, ſo that tho' this Statute be an eaſe to the Defendant, yet 'tis a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the Sheriff, who runs a greater hazard ſince the making of this Act than before; becauſe then he might keep him in priſon till the Debt was ſatisfied, but now he is obliged to let him at large upon Bail, from whom he is directed to take a Bond, which he may keep in his own hands to indempnifie himſelf: The Court can only amerce him, if the Defendant do not appear at the Return of the Proceſs, and 'tis not material to the party whether the Sheriff take one or more Security, that being in his diſcretion; ſome he muſt take, for otherwiſe 'tis directly in oppoſition to the Statute; neither is it material to the party whether they are ſuch as are ſufficient, for if they are not, and the Defendant is thereupon diſcharged, this will not amount to an Eſcape; becauſe nothing is done but what is purſuant to the Statute, and therefore he is no otherwiſe chargeable than by Amerciaments.</p>
               <p>The Statute was made and intended for the benefit of the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, not of the Creditor, and there might be ſome colour for the Action if the Sheriff might Return that he let him to Bail, for then it might have been neceſſary to have alledged the ſufficiency of them, which might have been traverſed; but now he muſt purſue the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Statute ſo far as to take Bail; he is the proper Iudge of the ſufficiency, and when the Bail is taken he muſt return a <hi>Cepi Corpus,</hi> ſo that he is only to be amerced till he bring in the Body, but an Eſcape will not lie againſt him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They find that the Company was ſeiſed in Fée of five Meſſuages in which were <hi>35</hi> Fire Hearths in the Month of <hi>April, 1673.</hi> And that the Company did never finiſh theſe Meſſuages, and that from the time of the building they ſtood all void, and unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by any Tenant or Tenants whatſoever.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:172213:99"/>
               <p>Then they find that the Collectors were lawfully authoriſed, and that ſuch a day they demanded the Duty for the Fire-Hearths in each of the ſaid Meſſuages, which they alſo demanded of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and which they refuſed to pay, and thereupon they took the diſtreſs and kept it till the Company paid the ſaid Duty, and ſo make a general Concluſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion was, whether the Owner of a new Houſe unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited from the time of the building thereof ought to pay this Duty during all that time?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> argued that they ſhall not be chargeable with this Duty; their general Reaſon was, becauſe no Duty ſhould ariſe to the King without ſome benefit to the Subject.</p>
               <p>And as to that it was ſaid, that in this Caſe both the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Crown and the Property of the Subject are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, from which, as from a Root, all theſe Impoſitions ariſe to ſuſtain the publique Charge. And therefore</p>
               <p>It hath been the way of Iudges in the Interpretations of Statutes, not only to conſider the benefit of the Crown, but to regard what is convenient for the Subject.</p>
               <p>There are two Reaſons for Impoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Such as are Cuſtoms, <hi>viz.</hi> Tunnage and Poundage and private Tolls, which come in lieu of other things, and ſo are <hi>quid pro quo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Subſidies or Grants from the People, which naturally ariſe in ſome proportion from a benefit to the Subject.</p>
               <p>And under the laſt of theſe Reaſons falls the preſent Duty given by the Act of <hi>14 Car.</hi> only to proportion the Revenue to the publique Charge of the Crown; and therefore 'tis not to be thought that the Parliament ever intended a Duty to the King where the Subject had no benefit, for <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit;</hi> and how can it be thought that a Duty ſhould be paid before the Subject hath any Rent, which is the Mother of the Duty; for if a Man expends <hi>1000 l.</hi> in building, which is all he is worth, and the Houſes ſhould happen not to be let, how can he then raiſe ſuch a Sum as muſt be paid to the King? And 'tis an Objection of no weight to ſay, if this Duty muſt not be paid till the Houſes are let, then the Revenue of the King depends upon a Contingency; becauſe all Duties which come to the Crown do depend upon ſuch.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered is the Act it ſelf, and as to that,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:172213:99"/>
                  <hi>1.</hi> It muſt be taken as an Act which gives a new Duty to the Crown, and thereupon ſuch Conſtruction ought to be made that the Subjects Eſtate be not charged further than the Words will bear; and for that reaſon it is to be taken in an ordinary ſenſe, and not to be ſtrained, though it had been in the Caſe of an old Duty; and for that the<note n="*" place="margin">7 Co. 21.</note> Lord <hi>Anderſon's Caſe</hi> is a good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>viz.</hi> The Statute of <hi>33 H. 8. cap. 30.</hi> makes <hi>all Mannors (which deſcend to any Heir whoſe Anceſtor was indebted to the King by Judgment, Recogniſance, Obligation or other Specialty) chargeable for payment of the Debt.</hi> Tenant in Tail is bound in a Recognizance to <hi>S.</hi> who is attainted; then Tenant in Tail dies and his Iſſue aliens <hi>bona fide,</hi> the King cannot extend the Lands ſo ſold, becauſe the Act ſhall not be conſtrued to mean all Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizances for the Kings Debts though the Words are general enough; and though 'tis not ſaid which way the Debts ſhall come to the King, either by Forfeiture, Attainder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they ſhall be taken in an ordinary ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch debts as were due to the King originally; for which reaſon it has been always held where an Act gives any thing to the King and lays a Charge upon the Subject, in ſuch Caſe it ought to have a moderate conſtruction.</p>
               <p>And that this Duty is a Gift cannot be denied, for 'tis called ſo in the very Act, therefore ſuch ought the Conſtruction to be, and the rather becauſe it is more for the Kings Honour it ſhould be ſo; and both in this Caſe as well as in Conſtructions of his Grants the Law hath more regard for his Honour than for his Profit.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> This being ſo called, a Duty or Tax by the very Words of the Act, doth in the natural ſenſe import a proportion out of that in which the Subject hath a benefit; and it will be ſcarce found that there hath been a general Tax given to the King where the Subject has rather received a loſs than any profit out of the thing taxed, becauſe it would be very hard to pay where a Man cannot receive.</p>
               <p>In the Caſe of Tunnage and Poundage proviſion is made that the Party ſhall have Allowance if the Goods be loſt by Pyracy, which was mentioned to ſhew how unlikely it was that the Parliament ſhould intend a Duty where the Subject had a loſs.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince the making the Statute of <hi>43 Eliz. cap. 2.</hi> Houſes that lay void and untenanted have neither paid to Church or Poor, which alſo ſhews how the Vſage hath beén in Caſes almoſt of the like nature.</p>
               <p>The next thing conſidered were the Clauſes in this Act of <hi>14 Car. 2. cap. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:172213:100"/>
                  <hi>1.</hi> The firſt Clauſe gives a Duty, <hi>viz. That every Chimny and Stove ſhall pay <hi>2 s.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The next Clauſe is to bring this Duty into a way of Charge, <hi>viz. That every Owner or Occupier ſhall give unto the Conſtable an accompt of the number of Hearths in Writing, and the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to tranſmit ſuch Accompts to the Seſſions, there to be enrolled by the Clerk of the Peace, and a Duplicate to be ſent into the Exchequer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which it is to be obſerved that where mention is made of bringing this Duty into a Charge, both <hi>Owners</hi> and <hi>Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers</hi> are named, but the <hi>Owner</hi> is not named in any place where the payment of the Duty is mentioned, but the <hi>Occupier</hi> only; ſo that from the very intent and reaſon of the Act he cannot be chargeable.</p>
               <p>The Accompt thus tranſmitted is to charge the Inheritance, and therefore it concerns the Owner to look after the Charge; but for empty Houſes he cannot be charged, becauſe the Act takes no notice of them in the Clauſe of Payment, but are purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted that being laid on the Occupier, and this appears by the Proviſo which is ſtrongly penned for the Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz. Provided that the Payments and Duties hereby charged ſhall be charged only upon the Occupier for the time being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not on the Land-Lord who lett and demiſed the ſame;</hi> ſo that by the Body of the Act every Houſe is charged, which being general might have given ſome colour to charge the Owner, but by the Proviſo the Payment is reſtrained to the Occupier, and if there be no ſuch, there ſhall be no Payment.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid that it cannot be inſiſted upon that an Owner is an Occupier, becauſe the legal acceptance of the Word <hi>Occupation</hi> doth only intend an actual Poſſeſſion and not a Poſſeſſion in Law, and ſuch is the meaning of the Statute by charging the Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier for the time being.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Proviſo extends to Caſes where Tenants run away and pay no Rent, (as it certainly doth) becauſe there is no Occupier then in being; what difference can there be between that and this Caſe where the Land-Lord in both hath no Rent? for if he ſhall not pay where he cannot receive Rent, why ſhould he pay where he hath none to receive?</p>
               <p>And that this was the meaning of the Parliament may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear by a Clauſe in the Act of <hi>16 Car. 2. cap. 3.</hi> made for collecting this Duty by Officers appointed by the King, which doth not inlarge the former Statutes, and by which 'tis En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, <hi>That if any Occupier ſhall leave his Houſe before any of the half yearly Feaſts, whereon this Duty is appointed to be paid,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:172213:100"/> that the next Occupier ſhall be chargeable with the ſame for the ſaid half year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Clauſe had been altogether vain and of no uſe, if empty Houſes had been chargeable with this Duty; for to what purpoſe was it to charge a ſucceeding Occupier when the Houſe it ſelf, though untenanted, was chargeable before?</p>
               <p>In this Act alſo, which ſupplies the defects of the former, this Duty is made payable unto the Officer upon demand at the Houſe where the ſame ſhall ariſe and grow due, and that in caſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal by the ſpace of an hour the Officer may diſtrein, which ſhews a Demand muſt be where there may be a Refuſal, and no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal can be where there is no Occupier.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another Clauſe which mentions both Owner and Occupier in this Act, and which ſaith, <hi>That no Proprietor, Owner or Occupier, ſhall be moleſted or charged, unleſs within two years after the Duty accrewed;</hi> ſo that where-ever a charge is laid, or an eaſe is given to the Subject, the Word Occupier and ſometimes both Occupier and Owner promiſcuoſlly are uſed; but where a payment is to be made, the Owner is never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and if ſo, nothing ſhall be intended within either of the Statutes, to enlarge this Duty upon the Subject, beyond the Words and plain meaning thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> There is another Point in this Caſe which concerns the King and all the People of <hi>England,</hi> that is, whether the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant here can be charged with a Diſtreſs (ſuppoſing this Duty is to be paid to the King) before any account of theſe Hearths is tranſmitted into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> which firſt ought to be done; or otherwiſe the conſequence will be, that the Officer may demand and take as much as he will at his pleaſure, and the King may be likewiſe prejudiced in his Revenue; for as the Collector may have from the Subject more than he ought, and more than he is empowered to take by the Law, ſo he may pay the King leſs.</p>
               <p>The Act directs, That an Account ſhall be taken by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and examined by the Conſtables; then to be tranſmitted to the Seſſions, there to be enrolled, and from thence ſent into the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> now what occaſion was there of all this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempnity, if that the King was entituled to a Diſtreſs upon a bare refuſal?</p>
               <p>This being a Rent Charge upon a Mans Inheritance, the King ſhall not be entituled to it but by matter of Record; for he cannot take or part with any thing, neither can he have any Eſtate or Profit rendered him out of another Mans Eſtate, but by matter of Record; ſo that it ſeems by the Act that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt is neceſſary to be tranſmitted into the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:172213:101"/> that the King is not entituled to a Diſtreſs for this Duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that be actually done, which is not only matter of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Crown, but in ſome meaſure intitles him to it, becauſe there is a Penalty of five pounds laid upon the Officer, who ſhall neglect to bring in ſuch accompt, which ſhews that the Subject ought not to be charged before; for which reaſons Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was prayed for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note>But on the other ſide it was argued by Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torny General, that empty Houſes ſhould pay this Duty: For the Attorny General ſaid, that the Words in the Act were ſo expreſs, that he was of Opinion that the very reading of them would clear the Point in queſtion.</p>
               <p>In their Arguments two things were conſidered upon the Statute of <hi>14 Car. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Firſt the general Clauſe which gives the Duty in the Body of the Act.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The diſcharge in the Proviſo.</p>
               <p>And if this be in the Body of the Act, and not excepted in the Proviſo, then the Duty is to be paid; and as to that it was ſaid, that this Duty was given in general Words, by which it appears, that there was a deſign and intent to charge empty Houſes, <hi>for every dwelling Houſe, Edifice, or Houſe whatſoever</hi> is to pay this Duty; and that if every Houſe, why not an empty Houſe?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, a Dwelling Houſe is not a Houſe wherein there <hi>hath</hi> not been an Inhabitant, but wherein ſome body <hi>doth</hi> actually live; and if a Man furniſhes a Houſe very well, if 'tis not inhabited, it is notwithſtanding an empty Houſe, and ſuch a Houſe as to ſome purpoſes in the Law is not a dwelling Houſe; for 'tis not a Manſion Houſe, ſo as to make it Burglary for the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it open.</p>
               <p>By the ſecond Clauſe, <hi>Every Owner or Occupier is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Account to be ſent into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi>
                  </hi> by which it appears that thoſe Words <hi>Owner and Occupier</hi> are not there uſed in a different ſenſe, for if the Occupier were only lyable, the Owner need not look after the ſigning the accompt of every Hearth.</p>
               <p>The third Clauſe takes notice, That if it ſhould happen there be no Occupier, then the Officer may go into the empty Houſe to examine if the account given him be true; now if an account is to be taken of ſuch Houſes as are charged by this Act, and an account is directed to be taken of empty Houſes, then ſuch empty Houſes muſt be charged; and this ſeemed to them to be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:172213:101"/> the intent and meaning of the Parliament, for there being a Return to be made of empty Houſes, if ſuch had not been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be charged, they would have directed a Return alſo to have been made of the non-inhabitancy.</p>
               <p>And therefore they thought that ſomething more than an <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupier</hi> was here meant, for otherwiſe the Word <hi>Owner</hi> had not been put in; the meaning of which muſt be that dwelling Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes come within the charge of Occupiers, and empty Houſes within the charge of the Owners.</p>
               <p>Then as to the Proviſo, That the Duty hereby ariſing ſhall be charged only upon the Occupiers and Dwellers of ſuch Houſes, their Executors and Adminiſtrators, that can in no ſort extend to diſcharge an empty Houſe, becauſe 'tis not the ſubject matter of the Proviſo; for the deſign and purpoſe of it was not to diſcharge the Duty, but to transfer the charge upon the Tenant where the Houſe was inhabited; for if a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhould be made, then no Duty ſhould be paid at all by the Owner himſelf if he ſhould live in his own Houſe.</p>
               <p>In the Caſe of a <hi>Modus decimandi</hi> 'tis payable by the Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and Poſſeſſor of the Houſe, and the Landlord is never charged but where there is no Occupier.</p>
               <p>As to the Objection, That 'tis hard to pay a Duty where a Man has no Profit; it was anſwered, That the Act took care that Men ſhould not ſtop up their Chimnies when once made, and that this Duty was paid for many Chimnies which were never uſed, and what Profit can a Man have of a Chimny he never uſeth? If there had been an Act that ſo much ſhould be paid for every Window, 'tis all one whether it had been for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or pleaſure, or whether the Window had been uſed or not; and there is as much reaſon that a Man ſhould pay for Houſes never Inhabited, as for ſuch as have been Inhabited and are afterwards without Tenants.</p>
               <p>This Act ought therefore to receive a favourable Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Preamble whereof mentions that it was for the encreaſing of the Kings Revenue, which is <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> and which is for the Peace and Proſperity of the Nation, and the protection of every ſingle perſon therein; and though a particular Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience may follow, the Party ought to ſubmit. When a Man builds a Houſe, he propoſes a Profit, and 'tis not fit the Kings Duty ſhould be contingent and depend till he has provided himſelf of a Tenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> As to the other Objection that was much relied on, <hi>viz.</hi> where the Act ſpeaks of an <hi>Accompt</hi> to be given, it mentions both <hi>Owner</hi> and <hi>Occupier;</hi> but where it directs the Payment of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:172213:102"/> the Duty the Occupier only is named, by which it was inferred that he alone was chargeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In <hi>16 Car. 2. cap. 3.</hi> Owner, Proprietor and Occupier are uſed promiſcuouſly, wherein it is provided that they ſhall not be charged unleſs within two years after the Duty accrued; now if the Owner was not chargeable, why is he mentioned there?</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Point, they conceived that the Duty being payeable to the King, he had a remedy by diſtreſs before the Accompt was certified into the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> for the Return was to inform the King what advantage he maketh of his Revenue, and no Proceſs iſſued upon it; beſides the Act veſts the Duty in him from <hi>Lady</hi>-day <hi>1662.</hi> And by reaſon of that he may diſtrain. The King hath no benefit by returning of the Account, that being only intended to prevent his being cheated, ſo that 'tis not to entitle but to inform him; 'tis only to return a juſt and true account; not but that it may be levied, and the King entitled before; and 'tis no inconvenience to the Subject, if there be no ſuch Account returned, for if the Officer diſtrain for more Hearths than in truth there are, the Subject has a proper remedy againſt him.</p>

               <p>If the King ſhould be ſeiſed in Fee of a great Waſt, which happens to be improved by his Tenants, and thereby Tythes become due, it may be as well ſaid, that he ſhall have no Tythes without Record, as to ſay he ſhall have no Hearth-Mony for Houſes newly erected, whereby his Revenue is increaſed.

               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> That one <hi>J. R.</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee of the Manor of <hi>Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and being ſo ſeiſed did demiſe all the Meſuages, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments that he had in the ſaid Manor, for a Term of years to <hi>N.

               <p>It was ſaid, That when a Man is ſeiſed of Lands where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are <hi>Mines</hi> open, and others not open; and a Leaſe is made of theſe Lands in which the Mines are mentioned.<note place="margin">Antea.</note> 'Tis no new Doctrine to ſay, that the cloſe Mines ſhall not paſs; Mens Grants muſt be taken according to uſual and common intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and when Words may be ſatisfied, they ſhall not be ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farther than they are generally uſed, for no violent Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be made to prejudice a Mans Inheritance, contrary to the plain meaning of the Words.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Mine</hi> is not properly ſo called 'till it is opened, 'tis but a Vein of Coals before; and this was the Opinion of my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in point, in his firſt <hi>Inſt.</hi> 54. <hi>b.</hi> Where he tells us,<note place="margin">5 Co. 12.

               <p>The Plaintiff replies, That the Cauſe of Action did not ariſe within the Iuriſdiction of that Court.</p>

                  <hi>4.</hi> It did not appear by what Authority the Court at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> was held whether by Grant or Preſcription.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> and firſt he ſaid, That the Plaintiff there ſets forth that <hi>levavit quandam querelam in placito tranſgreſſionis,</hi> which was well enough.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>taliter proceſſium fuit</hi> is the ſhorter and better way of Pleading, and therefore in a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> nothing is recited but the Iudgment; 'tis true, in a Writ of Error the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord muſt be ſet out, but that is not neceſſary here.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:172213:104"/>
               <p>Thirdly, 'tis too late now to queſtion the Iuriſdiction of the Inferiour Court, after the Party hath admitted it below; he ought firſt to have pleaded to the Iuriſdiction, but now is Eſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by his own admittance there; and ſince Iudgment is given upon it, 'tis not now to be queſtioned; but however, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Caſe of an Officer, if it was out of the Iuriſdiction he is bound to execute the Proceſs of the Court, and ſo this is a good excuſe for him, <hi>Dyer 61. 10 Co. 77.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let the Pleadings be good or bad, if the Declaration here be ill, the Plaintiff cannot have Iudgment; and that it was ſo, he ſaid that the Writ alledged an Impriſonment <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,</hi> but the Count an Impriſonment <hi>donec</hi> he paid <hi>5 l. 10 s.</hi> which is variant, and the Prothonotaries ſaid, that the Writ uſed always to mention <hi>donec, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Curia.</note>But the Court were all of Opinion, that the Count was well enough, for there was no matter therein contained which was not in the Writ; the Impriſonment was the <hi>Giſt</hi> of the Action, and the <hi>donec, &amp;c.</hi> might have been given in Evidence, becauſe 'tis only an aggravation and a conſequence of the Impriſonment, ſo that the Count is not larger, but more particular than the Writ: And as to the two firſt Exceptions, the Court was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Opinion, that there was no difficulty in them, or in the laſt Exception, but thought the Plea was well enough as to thoſe: And they alſo agreed that the Officer in this Caſe was to be diſcharged, for though the Proceſs be erronious, yet he is to obey and not to examine, <hi>2 Cro. 3. Weaver <hi>verſus</hi> Clifford:</hi> The great doubt in this Caſe was upon the third Exception as to the point of Iuriſdiction,<note place="margin">Sid. 151.

               <p>And as to that, the Chief Iuſtice, and <hi>Wyndham</hi> Iuſtice were of Opinion, That this was no good juſtification as to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff below; for if the cauſe of Action did ariſe without the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, of which he is bound to take notice, the proceedings <hi>quoad</hi> him, are all <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> and he cannot juſtifie the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of any Proceſs; ſo that if the Treſpaſs was done out of the Iuriſdiction of the Court, the Defendant below may bring an Action againſt the Plaintiff, and is not concluded here by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings there, but may alledge the cauſe of Action to ariſe out of the Iuriſdiction; and as to his being Eſtopped by admitting of the Iuriſdiction below, that cannot be, becauſe an admittance cannot give the Court a Iuriſdiction where it had none originally, and ſo he ſaid it was reſolved in one <hi>Squib's</hi> Caſe, in a ſpecial Verdict.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:172213:104"/>
               <p>He who ſues in an Inferior Court is bound at his peril to take notice of the Bounds and Limits of that Iurisdiction; and if the Party after a Verdict below prays a Prohibition, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that the Court had no Iurisdiction, a Prohibition ſhall be granted; and 'tis no Eſtoppel that he did not take advantage of it before, <hi>1 Roll. Abr. 545.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Iuſtice <hi>Atkins</hi> and <hi>Scroggs</hi> were of another Opinion, they agreed that if an Action be brought in an Inferior Court, if it be not ſaid to be <hi>infra Jurisdictionem Curiae</hi> they would never preſume it to be ſo, but rather to be without, if not alledged to be within the Iurisdiction, and here in the Plea 'tis not ſhewn at all; ſo that as the Caſe ſtands upon the Plea the Proceédings are <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> and there is no legal Authority to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them, and by conſequence the Officer is no more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed than the Party, becauſe alſo 'tis in the Caſe of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Iurisdiction: And ſo it hath béen adjudged upon an Eſcape brought againſt an Officer of an Inferior Court, wherein the Plaintiff declared that he had brought an Action upon a Bond againſt <hi>S.</hi> in the Court of <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and that he had Iudgment and Execution, and the Defendant ſuffered him to eſcape; this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration did not charge the Defendan, becauſe the Bond was not alledged to be made <hi>infra Juriſdictionem Curiae;</hi> for though ſuch an Action is tranſitory in its nature, yet the Proceedings in an inferior Court upon it are <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> if it doth not appear to be <hi>infra Juriſdictionem, 1 Roll. Abr. 809.</hi> though in the Caſe of a general Iurisdiction it might be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But here the Rejoynder doth help the Plea; for the Plaintiff having replied that the Treſpaſs was committed out of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and the Defendant having rejoyned that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in his Declaration below that the Treſpaſs was done within the Iurisdiction, 'tis now all one Plea, and the Plaintiff hath confeſſed it by his Demurrer; ſo that in regard it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged below and admitted there, 'tis a good Plea both for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and Party, and the Plaintiff cannot now take advantage of it, but is concluded by his former admittance, and it ſhall not be enquired now whether true or falſe.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>taliter proceſſum fuit</hi> they all held it well enough, and that there was no neceſſity of ſetting out all the Proceedings here as in a Writ of Error.</p>
               <p>And as to the laſt Exception 'tis ſaid that the Burrough of <hi>Warwick</hi> is <hi>antiquus Burgus,</hi> and that the Court is held there <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem,</hi> which is well enough.</p>

               <p>There is another <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for the Defendant <hi>ad faciend' &amp; recipiend';</hi> as to this the ſame Iurisdiction is here as in the Court of <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> if a perſon be near the Town by the courſe of the Court he may be brought hither to be charged and then the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> is returnable <hi>immediate;</hi> but if he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, it muſt then be returnable in the Court at a certain day; theſe are the <hi>Habeas Corpus's</hi> which concern the Iurisdiction of this Court, and are incident thereunto.</p>
               <p>There is another which concerns Priviledge, when the Party comes and ſubjects himſelf to the Court to be either bailed or diſcharged, as the Crime is for which he ſtands charged; and if he be priviledged, this Court may examine the Caſe and do him right; if a private man be committed for a criminal Cauſe we can examine the Matter and ſend him back again. Before King <hi>James's</hi> Reign there was no <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> but recited a Priviledge, as in the Caſe of Priviledge for an Attorny; ſo that if this Court cannot remedy what the Party complains, 'tis in vain for the Subject to be put to the trouble when he muſt be ſent back again; neither can there be any failure of Iuſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may apply himſelf to a proper Court; and of the ſame Opinion were <hi>Wyndham</hi> and <hi>Scroggs.</hi>

               <p>The Defendant pleads that all the ſix Months he was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at <hi>Morocco</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and that after his Return he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the Defendant; and to this Replication the Defendant demurred.</p>
               <p>And Serjeant <hi>George Strode</hi> maintained the Demurrer.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion was, whether the Plaintiff by neglecting to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Grant of the Annuity to the Defendant hath not diſpenſed with the whole Condition; and he held that it was diſpenſed withal, and that no Requeſt being made the Bond could not be ſued at the Common Law, and therefore the Replication was ill.</p>
               <p>'Tis not ſo much a disjunctive Condition to do one thing or another, but the laſt Clauſe is a Penalty to inforce the firſt; for ſeeing the Annuity is to be but <hi>20 l. per annum</hi> for a Life, and yet that <hi>300 l.</hi> is to be paid in caſe that be not granted, this proves it to be only a Penalty, becauſe Annuities at the higheſt value are but at eight years purchaſe, whereas this is fiftéen years purchaſe, ſo that the <hi>300 l.</hi> could never be intended as a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:172213:106"/> Recompence for the Annuity; neither could the Defendant poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſave the Condition, becauſe the ſame time is limited both for the Paymenr of the <hi>300 l.</hi> and granting of the Annuity, <hi>viz.</hi> within ſix Months; and the Plaintiff hath to the utmoſt time to requeſt the executing the Grant,<note place="margin">1 Sand. 287.</note> and therefore the other cannot pay the Mony before.</p>
               <p>But taking the Caſe to be that this is a disjunctive Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet ſince Conditions are always made in favour of the Obligor, the power of Election even in ſuch Caſes is left wholly in him; but according to ſuch Conſtructions, as would be made for the Plaintiff, the Election is gone from the Defendant,<note place="margin">Wright <hi>and</hi> Bull, Poſtea.</note> and left in the Obligée; for if he do not requeſt the Annuity, then the <hi>300 l.</hi> is to be paid, and this is directly againſt the Rules of disjunctive Conditions; and the Caſe of<note n="*" place="margin">Cor.

               </p>
               <p>The Defendant pleads nothing as to the delivery of the Bonds, but ſaith, that the Plaintiffs Council adviſed no Releaſe; and upon a Demurrer this was adjudged for the Defendant, becauſe in all Obligations with a Penalty the Election is always in the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor; and this being a disjunctive Condition each part is likewiſe in his Election; for if the Obligee ſhould not tender the Releaſe, the other is not bound to deliver the Bonds; and if he ſhould tender it, then the Obligor may either deliver the Bonds or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Releaſe, which he pleaſeth, <hi>4 H. 7. 4.</hi>

               <p>So a Man covenants to grant ſuch an Eſtate to his Wife or to leave her worth ſo much Mony, if ſhe ſurvive him, if ſhe dies before him the Condition is not broken, though he did not make ſuch Grant: In the Caſe of <hi>Warren <hi>and</hi> White</hi> it was lately adjudged in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> that where <hi>Warren</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to <hi>Warner,</hi> and <hi>White</hi> became bound with him to pay the Mony before the <hi>25th</hi> day of <hi>December</hi> then next following;

               <p>Which Caſe he agreed to be Law, becauſe there the valuation and worth of the Ship and the Mony to be paid was by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of a Stranger, and the Condition being for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Defendant he is to procure the Stranger to make an appointment what Sum ſhould be paid, or to deliver the Goods, otherwiſe the Bond is forfeited, and he hath expreſly agreed to do the one or the other.</p>
               <p>But this is not like the Caſe at the Barr, where 'tis not a Stranger, but the Obligee himſelf that muſt procure the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; for 'tis to be adviſed by his Council, and to be done at his Coſts; and therefore in<note n="*" place="margin">5 Co. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Lamb's Caſe</hi> it was held that if a Man be bound to give ſuch a Releaſe before ſuch a day as the Iudge of the Admiralty ſhall direct; there 'tis no Plea to ſay that he appointed none, for the Iudge being a Stranger to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">1 Roll.

                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>Serjeant <hi>Pemberton contra.</hi> It appears that one thing or the other was to be done in this Caſe; for if the Plaintiff demanded and tendred an Annuity, the Defendant was to ſeal it; and if he did not tender it, then likewiſe the Defendant was to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>viz.</hi> to pay <hi>300 l.</hi> So that the Plaintiff was either to have the Annuity or the Mony.</p>
               <p>He agreed that where the Obligor hath the Election, if in ſuch Caſe the Obligée ſhall wilfully determine it, that the Bond is thereby diſcharged.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:172213:107"/>
               <p>But if a Stranger take away the Election, 'tis no diſcharge, for in ſuch caſe the other part is to be performed.</p>
               <p>In this caſe the Plaintiff hath done no wilful Act to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Defendants Election, but all which is pretended is that he hath not done ſomething neceſſary to be performed, which is, that he hath not made a requeſt.</p>
               <p>But by his omiſſion thereof, the Defendants Election is not taken away, for though no requeſt was made within the ſix Months, yet the Defendant might have prepared a Grant of the Annuity himſelf, and have offered it to the Plaintiff, within the ſix Months, upon the laſt part of the day; and if he had thus ſet forth his caſe, and alledged that the Plaintiff made no requeſt, nor tendered him a Grant of the Annuity to Seal, this had been a good performance of the Condition, for he had done that which was the ſubſtance, which, though it was to be done at the Plaintiffs charge, yet the Defendant might have brought an Action for ſo much Mony by him laid to the uſe of the other; and the Caſes put in the principal Caſe in <hi>Moor 645.</hi> are expreſsly for the Plaintiff in this Caſe, where the Iudgment was, That if there be a Statute with a Defeazance, to make ſuch Conveyance as the Council of the Conuſee ſhall direct, the Cogniſor muſt prepare the Conveyance, if the other doth not; and there is a Caſe put where a thing was to be done at the Coſts of the Plaintiff, yet the Defendant did it at his own Charge, which he recovered of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iuſtice,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> and the whole Court were of Opinion that the Plea was good, becauſe the Defendant had the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Election, and the Plantiff not making the requeſt within the ſix Months, had diſpenſed with one part of the Condition, and the Law hath diſcharged the Defendant of the other part; and they relied upon the Caſe of <hi>Grenningham</hi> and <hi>Ewre,</hi> which they held to be good Law, and an Authority expreſs in the very point.</p>
               <p>In this Caſe the Obligee was to do the firſt act, <hi>Viz.</hi> To make the requeſt. Where the Condition is ſingle <hi>concilium non dedit adviſamentum</hi> is a good Plea to diſcharge the Defendant; ſo here the Condition is but ſingle, as to the Defendant; for though it be diſjunctive, yet the Plaintiff hath taken away the benefit of Election from the Obligor of doing the one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall be excuſed from doing the other.</p>
               <p>The Pleading as alledged by the Council of the Plaintiff, would not have been a good performance of the Condition, for if one be bound to Convey as the Council of the other ſhall
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:172213:108"/> adviſe, and he makes the Conveyance himſelf, this is not ſuch a Deed as was intended by the Parties, and ſo no performance of the Condition.</p>
               <p>But however the Defendant need not plead it, for he is not bound ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Here if the Plaintiff had requeſted the Sealing of ſuch a Grant of an Annuity, even the Defendant had liberty either to execute it, or to pay the <hi>300 l.</hi> and where the Election is on the Obligors part, neither the act or neglect of the Obligee ſhall take it away from him; for it would be unreaſonable that the Obligee ſhould have his choice, either to accept of the Annuity or the <hi>300 l.</hi> when 'tis a known Rule, That all Conditions where there is a Penalty in the Bond, are made in favour and for the benefit of the Obligor, and the <hi>300 l.</hi> in this caſe to be paid upon the refuſal of the Defendant to make ſuch Grant, is in the nature of a Penalty to enforce him to do it.</p>
               <p>The principal Caſe in <hi>Moor 645.</hi> was agreed to be Law, but the Rule there put was denied, as not adequate to the preſent Caſe, which was, that if by the Act of God, or of the Party, or through default of a Stranger, it becomes impoſſible for the Obligor to do one thing in a disjunctive Condition, he is notwithſtanding bound to do the other.</p>
               <p>This is true only as to the laſt Caſe, but not to the two firſt; and for an Authority<note n="*" place="margin">5 Co</note> 
                  <hi>Laughter's Caſe</hi> was full in the Point, which is, that when a Condition conſiſts of two parts in the disjunctive, and both are poſſible at the time of the Bond made, and afterwards one becomes impoſſible by the Act of God, or of the Party, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligor is not bound to perform the other part.</p>

Jones 93. 1 Ventris 307</note>IN a Prohibition; The Caſe was: A Man dies inteſtate having three Brothers of the whole Blood, and a Brother and Siſter of the half Blood; and the Queſtion was whether they ſhall be admitted to a diſtribution in an equal degreé.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> argued that they were all <hi>in aequali gradu,</hi> becauſe before the Act of Diſtribution the Ordinary had power to compel the Adminiſtrator to give and allot filial Portions to the Children of the deceaſed out of his Eſtate. And by the Civil Law ſuch proviſion is made for the Children of the Inteſtate that the Goods, which either the Father or Mother brought to each other
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:172213:108"/> at the Marriage, ſhall not remain to the Survivor, but the uſe and occupation of them only during Life, for the Property did belong to the Children.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of <hi>21 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> the Ordinary is to grant Adminiſtration to the Widow of the Inteſtate, or to the next of his Kin, or to both, as by his diſcretion he ſhall think good, and in Caſe where divers perſons claim the Adminiſtration as next of Kin, which be in equal degree, the Ordinary may commit Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration to which he pleaſeth, and his power was not abridged, but rather revived by this late Act, by which 'tis Enacted,<note place="margin">22 &amp; 23 Car. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That juſt and equal diſtribution ſhall be made amongſt Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or next of Kin in equal degree or legally repreſenting their Stocks <hi>pro ſuo cuique jure;</hi>
                  </hi> and the Children of the half Blood do in the Civil Law legally repreſent the Father, and to ſome purpoſes are eſteemed before the Vncles of the whole Blood.</p>
               <p>'Tis no Objection to ſay, that becauſe the Law rejects the half Blood as to Inheritances, therefore it will do the ſame as to perſonal Eſtates, becauſe ſuch Eſtates are not to be determined by the Common but by the Canon or Civil Law, and if ſo, the half Blood ſhall come in for diſtribution, for this Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirms that Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Winnington</hi> Sollicitor General <hi>contra.</hi> He agreed that before this Act the half Blood was to have equal ſhare of the Inteſtates Eſtate; but that now the Ordinary was compelled to make ſuch diſtribution, and to ſuch perſons as by the Act is directed, for he had not an original power to grant Adminiſtration in any caſe that did belong to the Temporal Courts,<note place="margin">Sid. 370, 371.</note> but it was given to him by the Indulgence of Princes, not <hi>quatenus</hi> a Spiritual Perſon, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſloes Caſe, 9 Co. Bendl. 133.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if he had not power in any Caſe, he could not grant to whom he pleaſed. But admitting he could, his power is now abridged by this Statute, and he cannot grant but to the Wife and Children or next of Kin in equal degrée or legally repreſenting their Stocks.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch legal repreſentation muſt be according to the Rules of the Common, and not of the Civil Law; for if there be two lawful Brothers and a Baſtard <hi>eigne,</hi> and a Queſtion ſhould ariſe concerning the diſtribution of an Inteſtates Eſtate, the ſubſequent Marriage according to the Law in the Spiritual Court would make the latter legitimate, and if ſo a legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative amongſt them; but this Court will never allow him ſo to be.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:172213:109"/>
               <p>But the Court were all of Opinion that in reſpect of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the half Blood is as near as thoſe of the whole, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are all alike and ſhall have an equal diſtribution; and that ſuch Conſtruction ſhould be made of the Statute as would be moſt agreeable to the Will of the dead perſon, if he had deviſed his Eſtate by Will; and it was not to be imagined if ſuch Will had been made, but ſomething would have been given to the Children of the half Blood: And thereupon a Conſultaion was granted.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> If <hi>Thomas</hi> the Covenantor had no Eſtate executed in him, yet <hi>William</hi> his Son in this Caſe may take by way of future ſpringing uſe, becauſe the Limitation of an Eſtate upon a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to ſtand ſeiſed, may be made to commence after the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors Death, for the old Seiſin of the Covenantor is enough to ſupport it.</p>
               <p>There is a great difference between a Feoffment to Vſes, and a Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed, for by the Feoffment the Eſtate is executed preſently, <hi>1 Co. 154.</hi> Rector of <hi>Cheddington</hi>'s Caſe; So if there be a Feoffment to <hi>A.</hi> for Life, Remainder to <hi>B.</hi> in

                  <hi>2.</hi> As to the ſecond Point, The Eſtate is not executed in <hi>Thomas,</hi> and therefore <hi>William</hi> cannot take it by deſcent; Heirs of his Body or Heirs Male, are good Words of Limitation to take by <hi>Purchaſe</hi> from a Stranger, but not from an Anceſtor, for there he ſhall take by deſcent, and for this there is an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Co.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:172213:111"/> 
                  <hi>Roberga</hi> in this Caſe had but an Eſtate for Life, for the Fee Tail veſted in <hi>Robert,</hi> and when he died without Iſſue his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Maud</hi> was Tenant in Tail, <hi>per formam Doni,</hi> and in a <hi>Formedon</hi> ſhe counted as Heir to <hi>Robert,</hi> which ſhe was not, neither was ſhe Heir to her Father at the time of the Gift, yet it was held good; for the Words, <hi>Viz.

               <p>If therefore no Vſe for Life veſted in <hi>Thomas,</hi> then <hi>William</hi> cannot take by deſcent, <hi>Dyer 156. Co. Lit. 22. Hob. 31. Dyer 309. 1 Co. 154.</hi> Lord <hi>Paget</hi>'s Caſe, cited in <hi>Hob. 151.</hi>

                  <hi>3.</hi> To the third Point, Admitting both the former to be againſt him, yet ſince <hi>Edward</hi> is dead without Iſſue, the Eſtate Tail is ſpent.</p>
               <p>But the whole Court were of Opinion,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> That <hi>William</hi> ſhould Inherit this Land in queſtion; for though at the Common Law a Man cannot be Donor and Donee, without he part with the whole Eſtate, yet 'tis otherwiſe upon a Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed to Vſes: And if any other Conſtruction ſhould be made, many Settlements would be ſhaken, in which nothing was more uſual now, than to Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed to the Vſe of himſelf, and the Heirs Males of his Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They all agreed alſo, That the Eſtate being well limited, <hi>William</hi> ſhould take <hi>per formam Doni</hi> as ſpecial Heir, for <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Donatoris in charta manifeſte expreſſa obſervetur;</hi> and 'tis apparent <hi>Thomas</hi> intended that <hi>William</hi> ſhould have it, or elſe the Limitation to his Heirs Males had been needleſs.</p>
               <p>So that taking it for granted, that the Eſtate Tail once veſted, is not ſpent by his dying without Iſſue, but it comes to <hi>William</hi> by deſcent, and not as a <hi>Purchaſor,</hi> for ſo he could not take it, becauſe he is not Heir, and till <hi>Thomas</hi> be dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, the Tail cannot be ſpent, ſo there was no difficulty in that Point.</p>
               <p>And they held the Opinions of <hi>Dyer</hi> and <hi>Saunders</hi> in <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold</hi>'s Caſe to be good Law, who were divided from the other Iuſtices, but they doubted of <hi>Pybus <hi>and</hi> Mitford</hi>'s Caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was Law or not; they doubted alſo whether by any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <hi>Thomas</hi> could be ſaid to have an Eſtate for Life by implication; they doubted alſo of the ſpringing Vſe, but they held that this Limitation was good in its creation, and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given accordingly.</p>

Mod.

               </p>
               <p>The Defendant pleaded the <hi>Statute of Limitations,</hi> to which the Plaintiff demurred.</p>
               <p>And the queſtion was, whether this Action was barely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Contract, or whether it had a Foundation upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Record?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If on the Contract only, then the Statute of 21 <hi>Jacobi cap.</hi> 16. is a good Plea to barr the Plaintiff of his Action, which Enacts <hi>That all Actions of Debt, grounded upon any Lending or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, without Specialty, ſhall be brought within ſix years next after the Cauſe of Action doth accrew;</hi> and in this Caſe nine years had paſſed.</p>
               <p>But if it be grounded upon matter of Record, that is a Specialty, and then the Statute is no barr.</p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Barrel</hi> held this to be a Debt upon a Contract, without ſpecialty, for when the Sheriff had levied the Mony, the Action ceaſes againſt the Party, and then the Law creates a Contract, and makes him Debtor, as it is in the Caſe of a Tally delivered to a Cuſtomer.</p>
               <p>It lies againſt an Executor, where the Action ariſes <hi>quaſi ex contractu,</hi> which it would not do if it did not ariſe <hi>ex maleficio</hi> as in the Caſe of a <hi>Devaſtavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, The Iudgment recovered by the Teſtator, is now ſet forth by the Plaintiff Executor, but that is not the ground but only an inducement to the Action, for the Plaintiff could not have pleaded <hi>nul tiel Record,</hi> ſo that 'tis the meer receiving the Mony which charges the Defendant, and not <hi>virtute Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii</hi> upon a falſe return; for upon the receipt of the Mony he is become Debtor, whether the Writ be returned or not, and the Law immediately creates a Contract; and Contracts in Law are as much within the Statute, as Actual Contracts made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parties.</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:172213:112"/>
               <p>All which was admitted on the other ſide; but it was ſaid that this Contract in Law was chiefly grounded upon the Record, and compared it to the Caſe of <hi>Attornies Fees,</hi> which hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged not to be within the Statute, though it be <hi>quaſi ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractu,</hi> becauſe it depends upon Matter of Record, <hi>Rolls Abridg. tit.

               <p>And afterwards in <hi>Michaelmas-Term</hi> following by the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Chief Juſtice, Wyndham</hi> and <hi>Atkins</hi> Iuſtices, it was held that this Caſe was not within the Statute, becauſe the Action was brought againſt the Defendant as an Officer, who acted by vertue of an Execution; in which Caſe the Law did create no Contract, and that here was a Wrong done, for which the Plaintiff had taken a proper remedy, and therefore ſhould not be barred by this Statute.</p>
               <p>Iuſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> was of a contrary Opinion; for he ſaid if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received Mony to his uſe due upon Bond, the Receipt makes the Party ſubject to the Action, and ſo is within the Statute.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sanders</hi> argued that he ſhould not pay it again; he ſaid this Caſe was never adjudged, and therefore could produce no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Point to warrant his Opinion, but parallel Caſes there were many.</p>
               <p>As if the Sheriff take Goods in Execution by vertue of a <hi>Fieri Facias,</hi> whether he ſells them or not, yet being taken from the party againſt whom the Execution was ſued, he ſhall plead that taking in diſcharge of himſelf, and ſhall not be liable to a ſecond Execution, though the Sheriff hath not returned the Writ; and the reaſon is becauſe the Defendant cannot avoid the Execution, and he would therefore be in a very bad condition, if he was to be charged the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>And if the Sheriff ſhould die after the Goods are taken in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, his Executors are liable to the Plaintiff to ſatisfie the debt, for they have paid <hi>pro quo,</hi> and 'tis in nature of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract raiſed by Law.</p>
               <p>By the Words of the <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciend'</hi> it doth appear that the deſign of the Writ is to enforce the Payment of the the debt by the Impriſonment of the Defendant: The Sheriff thereupon returns that he hath taken the Body, and that the Defendant hath paid the Mony to him, for which reaſon he diſcharged him; and for this Return he was amerced, not becauſe he diſcharged the Party, but becauſe he had not brought the Mony into the Court; for the Law never intended that a Man ſhould be kept in Priſon after he had paid the debt.</p>
               <p>In this Caſe the Defendant can have no remedy to recover it again of the Marſhal, becauſe it was not a bare Payment to him, but to pay it over again to the Plaintiff, and likewiſe in conſideration that he ſhould be diſcharged from his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be objected by the Marſhal that the Plaintiff hath an Action of Eſcape againſt him, and likewiſe by the Plaintiff that he did not make the Gaoler his Steward or Bayliff to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Mony.</p>

               <p>If he had come in <hi>Michaelmas-Term</hi> after the long Vacation, and informed the Court that he had offered to pay the Execution Mony to the Marſhal, and that he would not take it, and that the Plaintiff could not be found, the Court would have made a Rule to help him.</p>

               <p>That which hath been objected that the Party ſhall plead to a ſecond Execution, that his Goods were taken by a former <hi>Fieri Facias</hi> cannot be; for no ſuch Plea can be good, becauſe by that Writ the Sheriff hath expreſs Authority to levy the Mony; and the Plea is not Payment to the Sheriff, but that the Mony was levyed by him by virtue of the Writ, which ought to be brought into the Court, and an <hi>Audita Querela</hi> lies againſt the Plaintiff, and then the Defendant is to be bailed, <hi>1 Leon. 141.

                  <hi>FAlſe Impriſonment.</hi> The Defendant pleads ſpecially; the Subſtance of which was, that there was a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> directed to him amongſt others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that before him and the other Commiſſioners Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> two Preachers, were indicted for being at a Conventicle; to which Indictment they pleaded Not-Guilty, and this was to be tried by a Iury, whereof the Plaintiff was one; and that after the Witneſſes were ſworn and examined in the Cauſe, he and his Fellows found the Priſoners, <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Mead,</hi> Not-Guilty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were acquitted, <hi>&amp; quia</hi> the Plaintiff <hi>male ſe geſſerit</hi> in acquitting them both againſt the direction of the Court in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Law, and againſt plain Evidence; the Defendant and the other Commiſſioners then on the Bench fined the Iury 40 Marks a-piece, and for Non-payment committed them to <hi>New-gate, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Serjeant <hi>Newdigate</hi> argued that this Action would lie.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> It muſt be admitted that the Impriſonment of the Iury was unlawful, and then the conſequence will be, that all that was done at that time by the Commiſſioners or Iudges was both againſt <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and other Acts of Parliament, the Petition of Right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore their Proceedings were void, or at leaſt very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular to impriſon a Iury-man without Preſentment or due Proceſs in Law, and conſequently the party injured ſhall have an Action for his falſe Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>In <hi>10 H. 6. f. 17.</hi> In an Action brought for falſe Impriſonment the Defendant juſtifies the Commitment to be for Suſpicion of Felony; but becauſe he did not ſhew the ground of ſuch Suſpicion the Iuſtification was not good.</p>
               <p>The Trial of <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Mead</hi> and all incidents thereunto, as ſwearing the Iury, examining of the Witneſſes, taking of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and acquitting the Priſoner were all within the Commiſſion; but the fining of the Iury and the impriſoning of them for Non-payment thereof was not juſtifiable by their Commiſſion, and therefore what was done therein was not as Commiſſioners or Iudges.</p>
               <p>If this Action will not lie then the Party has a Wrong done, for which he can have no remedy; for the order for paying of the Fine was made at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> upon which no Writ of Error will lie; and though the Objection that no Action will lie againſt a Iudge of Record for what he doth <hi>quatenus</hi> a Iudge, be great, the Reaſon of which is, becauſe the King himſelf is <hi>de jure</hi> to do Iuſtice to his Subjects, and becauſe he cannot diſtribute it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all perſons, he doth therefore delegate his Power to his Iudges, and if they misbehave themſelves the King himſelf ſhall call them to account and no other perſon, <hi>12 Co. 24, 25.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that concerns not this Caſe, becauſe what was done here was not warranted by the Commiſſion, and therefore the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant did not act as a Iudge; and this difference hath beén taken and allowed, that in the Caſe of an Officer, if the Court hath Iurisdiction of the Cauſe no Action will lie againſt him for doing what is contrary to his Duty; but if all the Proceédings are <hi>coram non Judice</hi> and ſo void, an Action doth lie, <hi>10 Co. 77.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the Caſe of a Iuſtice of the Peace or Conſtable, where he excéeds his particular Iurisdiction; ſo if a Iudge of <hi>Niſi Prius</hi> doth any thing not warranted by his Commiſſion, 'tis void.</p>
               <p>And that the Commiſſioners here had no power to impoſe this Fine, he argued from the very nature of the pretended Offence, which was neither a Crime or in any wiſe puniſhable, becauſe what the Plaintiff did was upon his Oath; and for that reaſon it hath
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:172213:116"/> béen adjudged in the Caſe<note n="*" place="margin">Bridgman 131.</note> 
                  <hi>Agard <hi>and</hi> Wild,</hi> that an Action would not lie againſt one of the Grand Iury after an acquittal, for procuring one to be indicted for Barretry, becauſe he is upon his Oath, and it cannot be preſumed that what he did was in Malice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> gives the Party Liberty but no Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his Impriſonment, that muſt be by an Action of Falſe Impriſonment, if otherwiſe, there would be a failure of Iuſtice; and it might encourage the Iudges to act <hi>ad libitum,</hi> eſpecially in inferior Courts, where Mayors and Bayliffs might puniſh Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at their pleaſures, which would not only be a grievance to the Subject, but a prejudice to the King himſelf, becauſe no Iuries would appear where they are ſubject to ſuch arbitrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedings.</p>
               <p>An Action on the Caſe lies againſt a Iuſtice of the Peace for refuſing to take an Oath of a Robbery committed, <hi>1 Leon. 323.</hi> and yet it was objected that there he was a Iudge, <hi>Quaere, Brook 204. March 117.</hi> for which Reaſons he prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Curia.</note>But the whole Court were of Opinion that the bringing of this Action was a greater Offence that fining of the Plaintiff, and committing of him for Non-payment, and that it was a bold attempt both againſt the Government and Iuſtice in general.</p>
               <p>The Court at the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> had Iurisdiction of the Cauſe and might try it, and had power to puniſh a Misdemeanour in the Iury; they thought it to be a Misdemeanour in the Iury to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Priſoners, which in truth was not ſo, and therefore it was an Error in their Iudgments, for which no Action will lie: How often are Iudgments given in this Court, reverſed in the <hi>Kings Bench?</hi> And becauſe the Iudges have been miſtaken in ſuch Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt that needs be againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Petition of Right and the Liberties of the Subject? Theſe are mighty words in ſound but nothing to the Matter.</p>
               <p>There hath not béen one Caſe put which carries any reſemblance with this; thoſe of Iuſtices of the Peace and Mayors of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations are weak inſtances; neither hath any Authority been urged of an Action brought againſt a Iudge of Record for doing any thing <hi>quatenus</hi> a Iudge.</p>
               <p>That Offences in Iury-men may be puniſhed without Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no new Doctrin, as if they ſhould either eat or drink before they give their Verdict, or for any contempt whatſoever; but 'tis a new Doctrin to ſay, that if a Fine be ſet on a Iury-man at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> he hath no remedy but to pay it; for a <hi>Certio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:172213:116"/> may be brought to remove the Order by which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and it may be diſcharged if the Court think fit.</p>
               <p>As to what hath been Objected concerning the Liberty of the Subject, that is abundantly ſecured by the Law already; a Iudge cannot impoſe upon a Iury for giving their Verdict contrary to Evidence; if he doth any thing unjuſtly or corruptly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint may be made to the King, in whoſe Name Iudgments are given, and the Iudges are by him delegated to do Iuſtice, but if there be Error in their Iudgments, as here, 'tis void; and therefore the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> might refuſe to iſſue Proceſs upon it, and there needs no Writ of Error, for the very Eſtreats will be vacated.</p>
               <p>Though the Defendants here acted erroneouſly, yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion carried great colour with it, becauſe it might be ſuppoſed very inconvenient for the Iury to have ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as to give what Verdicts they pleaſe; ſo that though they were miſtaken, yet they acted judicially, and for that Reaſon no Action will lie againſt the Defendant; and Iudgment was given accordingly.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Judgment given upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of words in a Will. Jones 73. 1 Ventris 325.</note> in which the Iury found a ſpecial Verdict: The Caſe was, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Dr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> the Defendant, being an <hi>Alien,</hi> and a Subject of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> falling into Diſgrace there, had his Penſion taken from him by Publick Authority: Afterwards he came into <hi>England,</hi> and contracted a great Friendſhip with one Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of <hi>Windſor;</hi> Then a War broke out between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and the King iſſued forth his Proclamation, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſaid War, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to be <hi>Alien</hi> Enemies.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> being ſeiſed of the Lands now in queſtion, being of the value of <hi>200 l. per Ann.</hi> and upwards, made his Will in theſe words in Writing, <hi>Inter alia, <hi>Viz.</hi> Item I give all my Mannour of <hi>S.</hi> with all my Freehold and Copyhold Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to my dear Friend Dr. <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> during his Exile from his own Native Country; but if it pleaſe God to reſtore him to his Country, or take him
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:172213:118"/> out of this Life, then I give the ſame immediately after ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration or death, to Mrs. <hi>Abigal Hevenigham</hi> for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Peace was afterwards concluded between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> whereby all Intercourſes of Trade between the two Nations became lawful; but Dr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> was not ſent for over by the States, nor was there any offer of kindneſs to him, but his Penſion was diſpoſed of and given to another.</p>
               <p>That the Doctor might return into his own Country when he pleaſed, but that he ſtill continued in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whether he or the Leſſor of the Plaintiff Mrs. <hi>Heveningham</hi> had the better Title, was the queſtion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> Dr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> was enabled to take by Grant from the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>
                  <hi>Pemberton</hi> Serjeant for the Leſſor of the Plaintiff, argued that the Eſtate limited to the Defendant is determined, which depended upon the conſtruction of this Deviſe. He did agree that the Will was obſcure, and the intent of the Deviſor muſt be collected from the circumſtances of the Caſe; and it is a Rule, That according to the<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cro. 62, 371, 416.</note> intent of the Parties a Will is to be interpreted.</p>
               <p>'Tis plain then that the Deviſor never intended the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant an Eſtate for Life abſolutely, becauſe it was to depend upon a Limitation, and the Words are expreſs to that purpoſe, for he deviſes to him during his Exile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion is not ſo much what is the genuine and proper ſence and ſignification of thoſe Words, as what the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator intended they ſhould ſignifie.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Therefore the moſt proper ſignification of the Word <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile,</hi> is a penal Prohibiting a perſon from his Native Country; and that is ſometimes by Iudgment or Edict, as in the caſe of an Act of Parliament; and ſometimes 'tis choſen to eſcape a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Puniſhment, as in caſes of Abjuration and Tranſportation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he did not think that the Teſtator took the Word <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile</hi> in this reſtrained ſenſe, for Dr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> was never formally or ſolemnly Baniſhed; if that ſhould be the ſenſe of the Word then nothing would paſs to the Doctor by this Will, becauſe the Limitation would be void; and like to the Caſe of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to a Married Woman <hi>durante viduitate,</hi> and ſhe dies in the life-time of her Husband; or to a Woman Sole during her Coverture, or of a Deviſe to <hi>A.</hi> the Remainder to the right Heis of <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> dies living <hi>B,</hi> ſo that this could not be his meaning.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> The Word <hi>Exile</hi> in common parlance is taken only for abſence from ones Native Country; but this is a very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification of the Word, and nothing but a <hi>Catachreſis</hi> can juſtifie it; and therefore the Teſtator could not intend it in this ſenſe; 'tis too looſe and inconſiderable an Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Word for the Iudgment of the Court to depend on, unleſs there were circumſtantial Proofs, amounting almoſt to a Demonſtration that it was thus meant: But it plainly appears by the following Words this was not the meaning of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, for 'tis ſaid, <hi>If it pleaſe God to reſtore him to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> which ſhews that there was ſome Providence or other which obſtructed his return thither, and ſo could not barely intend a voluntary abſence; for if ſo, he might have expreſſed it; <hi>viz.</hi> during his abſence from his Country, or till his return thither, or whilſt he ſhould ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> and not in ſuch doubtful Words.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> By the Word <hi>Exile</hi> is meant a perſons lying under the diſpleaſure of the Government where he was born, or of ſome great perſons who have an Influence upon the Government, or have an Authority over him; which makes him think convenient (conſidering ſuch circumſtances) to withdraw himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to ſome other place; and this is a ſenſe of the Word between both the former, and even in the Common Law we are not ſtrangers to the acceptation of the Word in that ſenſe. There is a Caſe <hi>omni exceptione major</hi> in the Writ of Waſte, which is, <hi>fecit vaſtum de domibus, venditionem de boſcis, &amp; exilium de hominibus,</hi> 'tis in the Regiſter, and in the Writ on the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Marlebridge cap. 24.</hi> where by the <hi>exilium de hominibus</hi> is meant the hard uſage of Tenants, or the menacing of them, whereby they flie from their Habitations, <hi>2 H. 6. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis found in this Caſe that the Defendant was under the diſpleaſure of his Governours, the War broke out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might not then be ſafe for him to return; and for that reaſon he might think it ſafe for himſelf to abide here, and this Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> the Teſtator might know, which might alſo be the reaſon of making the Will.</p>
               <p>But now all acts of Hoſtility are paſt, and ſo the Defendants receſs is open, and it hath pleaſed God to reſtore the Doctor, but he is not pleaſed to reſtore himſelf, for the Iury find he is not returned; now if a Man hath an Eſtate under ſuch a Limitation to do a thing which may be done when it pleaſeth the party; in ſuch caſe if he neglect or refuſe to do the thing, the Eſtate is determined, <hi>15 H. 7. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:172213:119"/>
               <p>If I grant a Man an Annuity till he be promoted to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, and I provide a Preſentation for him, and he will not be Inſtituted and Inducted, the Annuity ceaſes; ſo ſhall the Eſtate in this Caſe, becauſe the Deviſor ſeems to appoint it to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant till he may return.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note>Mr. <hi>Holt contra,</hi> held that the Eſtate is not determined, but had a continuance ſtill. In his Argument he conſidered theſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Whether upon Dr. <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s coming into <hi>England</hi> (being under the diſpleaſure of the Government where he was born) he was an <hi>Exile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he held that he was an Exile, which Word in plainneſs of Speech, doth not only concern a perſon prohibited to live in his Native Country, by act of State, but one who leaves his Country upon other occaſions; and <hi>Calvin</hi> the Civilian in his <hi>Lexicon</hi> tells us, That an Exile is one <hi>qui extra ſolum habitat,</hi> and in all the deſcriptions of <hi>exilium</hi> 'tis divided into voluntary and involuntary; <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> uſe it in the ſenſe of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary leaving of a Native Country, where 'tis ſaid of <hi>Petrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in voluntarium profectus eſt exilium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Man leaves his Country upon the diſpleaſure of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, or fearing any Danger of Life, or even upon the Loſs of his Livelyhood, this is little different from involuntary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, and this is the Caſe of the Defendant; who, though he is not prohibited to continue in ſuch Exile, yet he is diſabled to return, and though he is not puniſhed for ſtaying, yet if he return, he is in danger of being ſtarved.</p>
               <p>As for the Caſe of <hi>exilium de hominibus,</hi> it makes for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants purpoſe, for in the <hi>1 Inſt. 53. b.</hi> 'tis ſaid, if Tenants be impoveriſhed, that is an <hi>Exilium,</hi> and have not the States taken away the Doctors Livelyhood and impoveriſhed him as much as they can? and therefore he had good cauſe to ſeek relief elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Now the ſame cauſe continues ſtill, for 'tis not found by the ſpecial Verdict that there was any reconciliation betwéen the States and him, or that he may have his Penſion again, if he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but on the contrary, that 'tis diſpoſed of to another; and 'tis apparent that there was a great Friendſhip between the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the Defendant, who took notice of the Circumſtances of Dr. <hi>Voſſius</hi>'s condition at that time, which is in no ſort altered from what it was at the time of the making of the Will; ſo that by the Word <hi>reſtored</hi> nothing elſe could be intended by Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> than when his Friend ſhould have the favour of the <hi>States,</hi> and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſubſiſtence in his own Country.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:172213:119"/>
                  <hi>2.</hi> Dr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> is not to be conſidered with any relation to the War, becauſe he came into <hi>England</hi> before the War pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; neither doth it appear by the ſpecial Verdict that he was any wiſe concerned in it: If a Subject of <hi>England</hi> go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Holland,</hi> and a War break out, 'tis no reſtraint of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon if he be not active in it, for he may return as he hath opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſo to do.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Admitting Dr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> to be concerned in the War, yet the Peace enſuing can be no Reſtitution of him to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that only extinguiſhes the Hoſtility between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and doth not reſtore the Doctor, who during the War ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo was a Rebel to the States; and for that reaſon a Peace ſhall not extend to pardon him.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> Admitting the Doctor to be no Exile, then the Limitation in the Will is void, and a void Limitation is like a void Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then the Eſtate is abſolute in him; if it had been a Condition precedent, as a Deviſe to him in caſe he was not an Exile, that had prevented the veſting of the Eſtate; but if the ſubſequent Limitation be impoſſible, they muſt ſhew on the other ſide that the Eſtate is determined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rainsford</hi> Chief Iuſtice was clear of Opinion, that the Eſtate doth continue in the Defendant by this Limitation, until the Circumſtances of his Caſe, (as to the Favour of the States, and the offer of his Penſion, or ſome competent way of Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) differ from what they did at the time of the making of the Will; and it doth not appear that there was any alteration of his Condition, nor any expectation of a Penſion from the States now, more than he had at that time.</p>
               <p>Whereupon in <hi>Michaelmas-Term</hi> following Iudgment was given for the Defendant <hi>Voſſius</hi> by the Opinion of the whole Court of <hi>King's Bench.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> was ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Aldenham</hi> in the County of <hi>Hartford</hi> in Fee, and the Lands in queſtion were held of the ſaid Lord by Copy of Court Roll, and are parcel of the aforeſaid Mannor.</p>
               <p>That the Defendant was admitted Tenant, and a Fine of 8 <hi>l.</hi> impoſed upon him for ſuch admittance payable at three diſtinct payments; that the 8 <hi>l.</hi> was perſonally demanded of him by the Lord's Steward, and he refuſed payment; whereupon the Lord enters and ſeiſes the Eſtate for a Forfeiture, which he would not have inſiſted on, but that the obſtinacy of the Defendant made it neceſſary for him to aſſert his Title and Right.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> his Steward, being ſworn gave E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that a Fine of 8 <hi>l.</hi> was ſet upon the Defendant when he was admitted, and that the Lands to which he was admitted were uſually lett for 7 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> ſo that the Fine was but a little more than a years value: That he himſelf demanded the 8 <hi>l.</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant being a Seafaring-man who refuſed to pay it. That he knew the Defendant to be the ſame perſon who was admitted to this Copyhold: That the Demand was made at the Stewards Chamber in <hi>Staple Inn,</hi> and becauſe it was payable at three ſeveral days, he then demanded of him only 2 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> as a third part of the 8 <hi>l.</hi> and that he did enter upon the 25th day of <hi>November</hi> laſt for Non-payment of the ſaid 2 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Council for the Defendant inſiſted that the Steward ought to produce an Authority in Writing given to him by the Lord to make this Demand and Entry upon refuſal,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> for the Lords owning it afterwards will not make a Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>But the Court held clearly that there was no need of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Authority in Writing,<note place="margin">Curia.</note> and that it was not neceſſary for the Steward to make a Precept for the ſeizure, but that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Demand ſhould be perſonal.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon why the Defendant refuſed to pay this Fine was, becauſe he ſaid that by a Decree and Survey made of this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Fine to be paid for this Copyhold was ſetled, and it was but 3 <hi>l.</hi> and no more.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:172213:121"/>
               <p>And Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> Solicitor General ſaid for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, that the Caſe was very penal on his ſide, but that he would make it clear that there was no colour for the bringing of this Action either as to the Matter or the Form.</p>
               <p>He ſaid that the Mannor of <hi>Aldenham</hi> had not been long in this noble Lord, he came in as Purchaſer or a Mortgagee under the Family of the <hi>Harvies</hi> whoſe Inheritance it was anciently; and there has been ſome doubt whilſt it was in their poſſeſſion what Fines were cuſtomary to be paid upon Deſcents and Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but that is now ſettled, and the Defendant was in the Caſe of a deſcent for which the Fine is not to be arbitrary at the Will of the Lord; but is reduced to a certainty in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Reign by Conſent and Agreement between the Lord and Tenants; and that a Survey was then made by vertue of a Commiſſion directed to ſome Men of Credit and Worth in thoſe days, who were impowred to ſet forth the quantity of Land and the value thereof, which was done accordingly; and it was then agreed that a year and an halfs value in caſe of a Deſcent, and two years value in caſe of an Alienation ſhould be paid as a Fine to the Lord, and the proportion of the value was then computed by the Commiſſioners, and decreed by the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> to be binding to the Lords and Tenants for ever.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion now is, how this years value ſhall be computed, the Lord would have it according to the improved value; the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will pay according as it was rated in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time by thoſe Commiſſioners: Now if this Land had decayed in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Tenant had ſtill been obliged to pay a Fine according to the valuation of that time; and if ſo, it would be very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make him pay for his Induſtry and Improvement of the Land now it is raiſed in value, becauſe that was done by his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and at his expence; ſo that the doubt being what Fine ſhall be paid, an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> will not lie, becauſe the Matter is doubtful, and the Law gives the Tenant Liberty to conteſt it with the Lord and will never let him be under the peril of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture becauſe he will not comply with the Lord to give up his Right without Law.</p>
               <p>But the Lord hath another and a more proper remedy, for he may bring an Action of Debt for the Fine thus impoſed, which will try the Right; and is not ſo penal to the Copyholder, which Point was lately reſolved: And that if a Copyholder had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable cauſe to induce him to believe that he ought not to pay the Fine demanded, (let the Right be as it would) yet no Ejectment will lie; for it muſt be only in a plain Caſe that the Lord can enter for a Forfeiture.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:172213:121"/>
               <p>For no Man forfeits his Eſtate, but by a wilful default in himſelf, ſuch a Forfeiture as is done and preſumed to be committed upon his own knowledge, but want of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be made a wilful neglect. 'Tis true, the Decree in <hi>Chancery</hi> made here cannot vary the Law, but it may be Evidence of the Fact; for <hi>prima facie</hi> it ſhall be intended that ſuch values have been paid time out of mind, becauſe the Court have ſo decreed; but then when the Fine was declared to be certain, a doubt did ariſe how the years value ſhall be reckoned, which has been ſetled alſo by another Decree, and from that time all the reſpective Lords of this Mannour have taken Fines according to that value which is mentioned in the Survey, and this Lord himſelf hath taken Fines in purſuance of the ſame, ſo that 'tis clear the Fine cannot be Arbitrary; but be it ſo or not, 'tis not material to this purpoſe, becauſe the Tenant hath a good and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable ground to inſiſt upon the Decree and Survey, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there is no wilful Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Baron agreed, That if it be a doubt, and the Tenant gives a probable Reaſon to make it appear that no more is due, than what he is ready to pay, 'tis no Forfeiture; but the Law in general preſumes that the Fine is incertain, if the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not ſhewed; now if the Tenants doubt did ariſe upon the equitableneſs of the Fine, in ſuch caſe if he refuſe to pay, 'tis a Forfeiture; but here it was whether it ſhall be paid according to the computed or improved value, and therefore he inclined that the Action would not lie.</p>
               <p>The Exemplification of the Decree was offered to be read, which being oppoſed, Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> informed the Court that nothing was more uſual, than to read a Sentence in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Court, or a Decree in <hi>Chancery</hi> as Evidence of the Fact: It being allowed to be read, the Council for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant took notice that the Commiſſion was therein mentioned which was returned into <hi>Chancery,</hi> and burned when the Six Clerks Office was on fire, in the year 1618. but a Duplicate thereof was produced which the Defendant had from the Heir of the <hi>Harveys,</hi> and ſo the Survey was praied to be read, which was opopſed by Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> for he ſaid that it was no Duplicate, the Commiſſioners Names being all written with one Hand, and no proof being made that it was a true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of that which was returned; he likewiſe obſerved upon the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Decree, that it was an Evidence for the Plaintiff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if there had been a ſetled Rule for payment of the Fines, there had been no occaſion to ſeek relief in Equity, and that there
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:172213:122"/> was no reaſon that the Defendant ſhould come into a Court of Law to prove ſuch Settlement by a Decree in <hi>Chancery,</hi> for if there be ſuch a Decree his Remedy is proper there; beſides, the Decree it ſelf only mentions the years value, which was to be ſetled by the Commiſſioners, and which he ſaid was never done, ſo that the Decree which appointed the Commiſſion was not compleated, and therefore being but executory, is of no force even in Equity.</p>
               <p>The Court were doubtful in the matter, and Baron <hi>Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſaid, That no Action of Debt would lie for this Fine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was neither upon the Contract, nor as <hi>ex quaſi contractu:</hi> But as to that Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> anſwered, That many Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions had been made in his time of Caſes, wherein the Old Books were ſilent.</p>
               <p>Vpon the whole, the Court thought this to be a proper Caſe for Equity, and ſo directed a Iurour to be withdrawn, which was accordingly done.</p>

Jac. 120.</hi> There were two Vills, <hi>Walton</hi> and <hi>Street</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Street,</hi> and a Fine was levied of Lands in <hi>Street;</hi> it was adjudged that the Lands in <hi>Walton</hi> did not paſs by this Fine.</p>
               <p>But there is another Report of this very Caſe, by my Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Roll</hi> in his <hi>Abr. tit.

                  <hi>2.</hi> The other Caſe is that of <hi>Baker <hi>and</hi> Johnſon</hi> in <hi>Hutton 106.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Caſe is quite different from that, becauſe there was neither Vill or Pariſh named in the Indenture; but here the Indenture was right, for the Lands are mentioned therein to lie in the Pariſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for theſe Reaſons Iudgment was prayed for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>This Caſe was afterwards argued in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, by Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> and <hi>Maynard</hi> for the Plaintiff, who ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>That the Government of this Nation was Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; the Eccleſiaſtical runs by Pariſhes, and the Civil by Vills; That a Pariſh is conſtituted by the Eccleſiaſtical Power, and may be altered by the King and Ordinary of the place, that the Parſon was ſuperintendent of the Pariſh, and the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Vill, which was alſo conſtituted by the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:172213:124"/> and from hence it is, that in real Actions which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, Lands ought not to be demanded as lying in a Pariſh, but within a Vill, that being the place known to the Civil Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction; and if a Treſpaſs which is local be laid at <hi>Dale</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, there being both the Pariſh and Vill of <hi>Dale,</hi> the proof of the Treſpaſs done in the Pariſh is not good, for it muſt be at the Vil.</p>
               <p>They agreed, that in conveying of Lands a Fine or Common Recovery of Lands in a Pariſh or <hi>Lieu conus</hi> was good, <hi>2 Cro. 574.</hi> But if there be both a Vill and a Pariſh of the ſame Name and ſeverally bounded, if the Vill be only named without the Pariſh, nothing doth paſs, but what is in the Vill, becauſe where a place is alledged in Pleading it muſt be of a Vill, <hi>Moor 710.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And this was the ancient way of demanding Lands in a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe quod reddat,</hi> becauſe of the Notoriety of Vills from whence <hi>Viſnes</hi> do ariſe; and becauſe the Vill is more particular and of more certainty than a Pariſh, and therefore 'tis requiſite that the Demandant ſhould be very particular in his Demand, that the Tenant may know how to make his defence, and the Sheriff of what to deliver poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Beſides a Vill is more ancient than a Pariſh, and Lands have been demanded within them time out of mind, ſo that the Demand (when 'tis doubtful of what 'tis made) ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of that which is moſt ancient; and ſuch Conſtruction is moſt conformable to the like Caſes, for <hi>Additio probat Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem;</hi> and therefore if Father and Son are both of one Name, and mention is made of one without an addition of <hi>Junior</hi> the Law intends the Father; ſo the Vill being more ancient than the Pariſh, that ſhall be intended if the Pariſh is not named.</p>

               <p>As to the finding of the Iury, that doth not help if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery be not full, for they may expound, but they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:172213:125"/> each other; In a <hi>Formedon, nient compriſe</hi> in the Record and not what is compriſed in the Deed is the Plea. Things upon a Record are open to the View of all People, but a Deed is a Pocket Record, and the perſons whom it concerneth cannot come at the ſight of it; ſo Fines are open and to be ſeen by all, and are to be proclaimed, but according to this Interpretation Déeds ſhould be alſo proclaimed.</p>
               <p>And there is a manifeſt difference between things conteined in a Fine and in a Déed; for a Fine of a Tenement is not good, but a Deed of a Tenement is well enough, but will not help the Fine; and therefore Men ſhould not go out of the Rules of the Law to help a Miſtake: For which Reaſons they prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>But the whole Court were of Opinion that the Lands in the Pariſhes did well paſs; for as Fines and Recoveries did grow in uſe, and are now become Common Aſſurances, they are to be favoured in the Law: And it hath been a Rule, that even in doubtful things Conſtructions ſhall be made to ſupport a Deed if poſſible, <hi>Ut res magis valeat quam pereat, Co. Lit. 183.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Rippon</hi> generally the Vill ſhall be intended, but <hi>ſtabitur praeſumptio donec probetur in contrarium,</hi> and that is proved by the Deed which ſhews where the Lands lye.</p>

               <p>In the Caſe of <hi>Brock <hi>and</hi> Spencer</hi> a Treſpaſs was laid in <hi>Hurſly,</hi> and it was not ſaid whether Vill or Pariſh; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleaded that the Lands were held of the Mannor of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Hurſley, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Venire Facias</hi> was <hi>de Vicineto</hi> only, and not <hi>de Vicineto Parochiae Hurſley,</hi> and it was adjudged good, for the Vill and the Pariſh ſhall be underſtood to be the ſame.</p>
               <p>And as to this purpoſe they were all of Opinion that there was no difference between a Fine and Recovery; 'tis true, the Law originally took notice of a Vill only, becauſe the diviſion of a County into Pariſhes was of Eccleſiaſtical diſtribution; but now by proceſs of time that diſtinction is taken notice of in in Civil Affairs; and the Law hath great regard to the Vſage and Practice of the People, the Law it ſelf being nothing elſe but common Vſage, with which it complies, and alters with the exigency of Affairs; it was but lately that the Curſitors would put the Word <hi>Pariſh</hi> into a Writ; for if a Note was delivered
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:172213:125"/> to them of Lands in the Pariſh of <hi>Dale,</hi> they uſed always to make it of Lands in <hi>Dale,</hi> till the Court ordered them to do otherwiſe; ſo that though the Common Vſage was ſo formerly 'tis now otherwiſe, and the Reaſon of things changing the things themſelves alſo change.</p>
               <p>And if this Recovery ſhould not be conſtrued to paſs the Lands, the intention of the Parties would faile; 'tis true there is no Authority expreſs in the point to guide this Iudgment, nor is there any againſt it; but if ſuch ſhould be, the Opinion of the Court is not to be bound againſt apparent Right; and 'tis for the honour of the Law that Men ſhould enjoy their Bargains according as they intended; for which Reaſons Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given for the Defendant.</p>

               <p>My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his <hi>4th Inſtitutes fol. 7.</hi> takes notice of this miſtake in the printed Books.</p>
               <p>But the Court were all of Opinion,<note place="margin">Curia.</note> that though it was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and ought to have been otherwiſe, yet being after<note n="*" place="margin">Dyer 95. Yelvert. 127. 2 Cro. 111. pl. 9. Br. Abr. tit.

               <p>The Serjeant perceiving the Opinion of the Court deſired time to ſpeak to it being a new Point, and told the Court that they ought to take notice of the Commencement of private Acts, which the whole Court denyed.</p>
               <p>And the Chief Iuſtice ſaid, that they were not bound to take notice of the Commencement of a general Act, for the Court was only to expound it; and though this had not been in the Caſe of a particular Act (where 'tis clear the Defendant ought to plead <hi>Nul tiel record</hi>) yet being after Verdict 'tis well enough, becauſe the Party took no benefit of it upon the Demurrer, and becauſe of the multiplicity of Preſidents which run that way.</p>
               <p>So in the Caſe upon the Statute of Tythes, though it be miſtaken, yet it hath often been held good; as if an Action be brought upon that Statute for not ſetting out of Tythes, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>quod cum quarto die Novembris anno ſecundo Edw. 6.</hi> It was Enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Parliament began <hi>1 Ed. 6.</hi> and was continued by Prorogation until <hi>4 Novembris,</hi> yet this hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been held good, and <hi>Multitudo errantium tollit peccatum.</hi>

               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:172213:127"/>
               <p>And though in this Caſe the Parliament was adjourned, but in that upon the Statute of <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> it was prorogued, yet the Chief Iuſtice ſaid, that as to this purpoſe there was but little difference between an Adjournment and a Prorogation; for an Adjournment is properly where the Houſe adjourn themſelves, and a Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is when the King adjourns them.</p>
               <p>But Iuſtice <hi>Atkins</hi> doubted whether the Court ought not to take notice of the Commencement of a general Act, and could have wiſhed that there had been no ſuch reſolution as there was in the Caſe of <hi>Partridge <hi>and</hi> Strange</hi> in <hi>Pl.

               <p>But he held that there was a manifeſt difference betwéen an Adjournment and a Prorogation; for an Adjournment makes a Seſſion continue; but after a Prorogation all muſt begin <hi>de novo;</hi> and that an Adjournment is not always made by themſelves, for the Chancellor hath adjourned the Houſe of Péers <hi>ex mandato Domini Regis;</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> adjourned the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by Commiſſion under the Great Seal.<note place="margin">4 Iuſt. 7</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> being poſſeſſed of ſeveral Sheep ſells them in a Market to <hi>Alſton,</hi> but did not deliver them to the Vendée, and afterwards in that very Market they diſcharge each other of this Contract, and a new Agreément was made between them, which was, that <hi>Alſton</hi> ſhould drive the Sheep home and depaſture them till ſuch a time, and that during that time <hi>H.</hi> would pay him ſo much every Week for their Paſture; and if at the end of that time (then agreed between them) <hi>Alſton</hi> would pay <hi>H.</hi> ſo much for his Sheep (being a price then alſo agreed on) that then <hi>Alſton</hi> ſhould have them.</p>
               <p>Before the time was expired <hi>H.</hi> ſells the Sheep to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff <hi>Mires,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Alſton</hi> ſells them to one <hi>Marwood,</hi> who brought a <hi>Replevin</hi> againſt the Plaintiff for taking of the Sheep; and the Officers together with <hi>Solebay</hi> the Defendant (who was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:172213:127"/> Servant to <hi>Marwood</hi>) did by his Order, and in aſſiſtance of the Officers drive the Sheep to <hi>Marwood's</hi> Grounds where they left them.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff demands the Sheep of <hi>Solebay,</hi> and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to deliver them, brings this Action againſt the Servant, and whether it would lye or not was the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>It was urged at the Barr, that the Action would not lie againſt the Defendant, becauſe he had not the poſſeſſion of the Goods at the time of the Action brought; for he preſently put them into his Maſters Ground: And it was ſaid, if <hi>A.</hi> find Goods and <hi>S.</hi> takes them away before the Action brought <hi>Trover</hi> will not lie againſt <hi>A.</hi> but 'tis otherwiſe, if he ſell them.</p>
               <p>In this Caſe it would have been a Breach of Truſt in the Servant to have delivered the Goods belonging to his Maſter, to another: 'Tis true, if there be a Converſion, though the poſſeſſion be removed before the Action brought, yet the Action will lie, but that is becauſe of the Converſion.</p>
               <p>Many Caſes were put where the Servant is not lyable to an Action for a thing done by the Command of his Maſter; and where a Bayliff, who is but a Servant to the Sheriff, ſhall not be charged in a falſe Return made by his Maſter, <hi>Cro. Eliz. 181.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Roll. Abr. 94, 95.</note> So if a Smiths Man prick an Horſe, the Action lies againſt the Maſter and not againſt the Servant.</p>
               <p>The Court before they delivered any Iudgment in this Caſe premiſed theſe two things: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That 'tis neceſſary in <hi>Trover</hi> to prove a Property in the Plaintiff, and a <hi>Trover</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> in the Defendant: And it was ſaid by Iuſtice <hi>Atkins</hi> (but denied by the Chief Iuſtice) that though Goods are ſold in a Market, yet the property is not changed till the delivery, for which he cited <hi>Keilway 59, 77.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Court held clearly in this Caſe, that the firſt Sale to <hi>Alſton</hi> was defeated by the Agreement of the Parties afterwards; for when a Bargain is made, and all the Parties conſent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it, and other Conditions are propoſed, the new Agreement deſtroys the former Bargain. And the Chief Iuſtice ſaid, that if an Horſe was bought in a Market, for which the Vendeé is to pay <hi>10 l.</hi> if the ready Mony be not paid the property is not altered, but the Party may ſell him to another.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> This new Agréement to have the Sheep, if <hi>Alſton</hi> would pay ſuch a Sum of Mony at a future day, will not amount to a Sale, and the new property is changed, and conſequently the Sale by <hi>H.</hi> to the Plaintiff before the day is good, and ſo the property of the Sheep is in him.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:172213:128"/>
               <p>But by the Opinion of the whole Court the Action would not lie againſt the Defendant.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Defendant could be guilty of no Converſion, unleſs the driving the Cattle by vertue of the Replevin would make him guilty; but at that time the Sheep were <hi>in cuſtodia Legis,</hi> and the Law did then preſerve them ſo that no property can be changed, and if ſo, then there could be no Converſion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Action will not lie againſt the Servant, for it being in Obedience to his Maſter's Command, though he had no Title, yet he ſhall be excuſed: And this Rule Iuſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> ſaid would extend to all Caſes where the Maſter's Command was not to do an apparent Wrong; for if the Maſter's Caſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon a Title, be it true or not, 'tis enough to excuſe the Servant; for otherwiſe it would be a miſchievous thing, if the Servant upon all occaſions muſt be ſatisfied with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Title and Right before he obey his Commands; and 'tis very requiſite that he ſhould be ſatisfied if an Action ſhould lie againſt him for what he doth in Obedience to his Maſter: But it was ſaid, the<note n="*" place="margin">Wyne <hi>and</hi> Rider, antea.</note> Servant cannot plead the Command of his Maſter in Barr of a Treſpaſs; and it was likewiſe ſaid, that in this Caſe the driving of the Cattle by the Servant to the Grounds of his Maſter, or a Strangers helping to drive them without being requeſted, is juſtifiable.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Becauſe what was done by the Defendant was done in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Proceſs of the Law, and he might as well juſtifie as the Officer; for if he forbid the Defendant to have aſſiſted him, yet his aſſiſting him afterwards would not have made him guilty, becauſe done in Execution of the Law.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> Becauſe 'tis not found that the Servant did convert the Sheep to his own uſe; for the ſpecial Verdict only finds the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and the Refuſal, which is no Converſion; and though 'tis an Evidence of it to a Iury, yet 'tis not Matter upon which the Court can give Iudgment of a Converſion, <hi>10 Co. 57.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Iury ſhould have found the Converſion as well as the Demand and Refuſal,<note place="margin">2 Bulſtr. 313. 1 Roll. Abr. 5.</note> like the Caſe in <hi>2 Roll. Abr. 693.</hi> In an Aſſiſe of Rent ſeek, upon <hi>Nul tort</hi> pleaded the Iury found a Demand and Refuſal, <hi>&amp; ſic diſſeiſivit;</hi> it was held to be no good Verdict, for the Demand ought to have been found on the Land, and ſhall not be ſo intended unleſs found.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff here hath ſet forth in his Declaration a Requeſt to deliver; then a Refuſal and Converſion too, which ſhews that they ought to be found, becauſe diſtinct things; and the finding of the Demand and Refuſal was only a preſumptive, not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:172213:128"/> proof of the converſion; and if the Iury themſelves know that there was no converſion, yet the Plaintiff hath failed in his Action; as if a Trover be brought for cutting Trees and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them away, and the Iury know that though the Defendant cut them down, yet they ſtill lay in the Plaintiffs Cloſe, this is no converſion.</p>
               <p>And though it hath been ſtrongly inſiſted at the Bar, that the Court ſhall intend a converſion unleſs the contrary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are to direct a Iury to find the demand and refuſal to be a converſion, and the Opinion of <hi>Dodridge <hi>and</hi> Croke,</hi> in <hi>1 Roll. Rep. 60.</hi> was much relied on, where <hi>Adams</hi> recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt <hi>Lewis 40 l.</hi> in the Court of <hi>Exon,</hi> and three Butts of Sack were taken in Execution, and the Plaintiff depoſited <hi>22 l</hi> in the Hands of the Defendent to prevent the Sale of the Sack, which was to be a pledge to return it upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, if the Defendant was not paid before the next Court day; the Iury found the Debt was not paid, and that no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was made to return the Sack, but that the Plaintiff re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the Defendant to return the Mony: Yet it was held by thoſe two Iuſtices, That the Law would ſupply the proof of a<note n="*" place="margin">Bulſtr. 308. Cro. Eliz. 495. Goldſ. 152. Moor 460. Stiles 361.</note> converſion though it was not found, for it ſhall be preſumed that the Mony was denied to the Plaintiff, and that the Defendant might uſe it himſelf; and becauſe no other proof could be made, that very denial ſhall be a converſion in Law; ſo a denial of a Rent Seck after demand is a diſſeiſin,<note place="margin">Pl.

               </p>
               <p>But the Court ſaid, That notwithſtanding this Authority, they would not intend a Converſion, unleſs the Iury had found it, eſpecially in this Caſe, becauſe they ought to have found it to make the Servant lyable, for if the converſion was to the uſe of his Maſter, there is no colour for this Action to be brought againſt the Defendant, but it ought to be brought againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>Whereupon a <hi>Ve. fa. de novo</hi> was prayed to help the Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Verdict, the converſion not being found; but the Court ſaid it was to no purpoſe to grant a new Tryal, unleſs the Plaintiff had a new Caſe; and ſo Iudgment was given for the Defendant.</p>

               <head>Attorny General <hi>verſus</hi> Alſton.</head>
               <p>AN Inquiſition upon an Accompt ſtated went out to inquire what Lands one <hi>Havers</hi> had in the twentieth year of this King, or at any time ſince,<note place="margin">Where the Kings Title is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to that of the Ter-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Lands of his Receiver ſhall not be liable by the Statute of the 13th <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                  </note> he being the Receiver General in the Counties of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Iury found that he was ſeiſed of ſuch Lands, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon an Extent goes out to ſeiſe them into the Kings Hands, for payment of 1100 <hi>l.</hi> which he owed to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alſton</hi> the Ter-tenant pleads that <hi>Havers</hi> was indebted to him, and that he was ſeiſed of thoſe Lands in 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. which was before the Debt contracted with him, and that he became a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt likewiſe before he was indebted to the King, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Lands were conveyed to the Defendant by aſſignment from the Commiſſioners of Bankrupcy, for the Debt due to him from <hi>Havers, abſque hoc</hi> that he was ſeiſed of theſe Lands at the time he became indebted to the King.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Attorny General</hi> replies, That he was ſeiſed of theſe Lands before the Commiſſon of Bankrupcy iſſued, and before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Bankrupt, and that at the time of his Seiſin he was Receiver, and accountable for the receipt to the King, and being ſo ſeiſed in the 20the year of this preſent King, he was found in Arrear 1100 <hi>l.</hi> for the payment whereof he was chargeable by the Statute of the 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Which ſubjects all the Lands of a Receiver which he hath or ſhall have in him during the time he remains accomptable,</hi> and ſo prays that the Kings Hands may not be amoved: To this the Defendant demurred.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Sawyer</hi> for him held, that the Replication was ill both in form and Subſtance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth not appear that the Defendant continued Receiver from the time he was firſt made, as it ought to be, or elſe that he was Receiver during his Life; for if a Man is Receiver to the King, and is not indebted but is clear, and ſells his Land and ceaſes to be Receiver, and afterwards is appointed to be Receiver again, and then a Debt is contracted with the King, the former Sale is good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Replication is a departure from the Inquiſition, which is the Kings Title, for the Lands of which Inquiry was to be made, were ſuch which <hi>Havers</hi> had 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſhews that <hi>Havers</hi> was not then ſeiſed thereof, but makes
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:172213:130"/> a good Title to himſelf, by Indenture of Bargain and Sale made to him by the Commiſſioners of Bankrupcy, and ſo the <hi>Attorny General</hi> cannot come again to ſet up a Title prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Defendant, for that is a departure; 'tis enough for the Defendant that he hath avoided the Kings Title, as alledged; and though Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> is not bound to take Iſſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Traverſe, yet he cannot avoid waveing both the Title of the Defendant and the King, by inſiſting upon a new matter.</p>
               <p>It was agreed, That the King had two Titles, and might either have brought his Inquiſition grounded upon the Debt ſtated, or upon the Statute of the 13th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> upon <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> his becoming Receiver; but when he hath determined his Election, by grounding it upon the Debt ſtated, he cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards have recourſe to the other matter, and bring him to be liable from the time of his being Receiver; as if an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition goes to inquire what Lands the Debtor of the King had ſuch a day when he entred into a Bond, if there be an anſwer given to that, Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> cannot afterwards ſet up a precedent Bond, becauſe 'tis a departure, and the Statute it ſelf veſts no Eſtate in the King, but makes the Receivers Lands lyable as if he had entred intred into a Statute Staple.</p>
               <p>The Inquiſition therefore ſhould have been grounded upon the Statute, and then the Defendant might have pleaded the Act of Indempnity, of which he might have the benefit, but if not he may be let into the Equity of the Statute of the 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. <hi>which gives liberty to Purchaſers to have contribution, and to plead ſufficient matter if they have any in diſcharge of the Debt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>But on the other ſide it was ſaid that the Replication was good, for if the Sale was after his being Receiver, though before he became indebted, yet by the Statute of the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Lands are ſubject to a Debt contracted afterwards, becauſe it hath a Retroſpect to the time he was firſt Receiver.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pl. Com. 321. Dyer 160.</note>By the Common Law both the Body and Lands of the Kings Debtor were lyable from the time he became indebted; but becauſe ſuch Debtors oftentimes ſold thoſe Lands which they had whilſt they were Officers, and ſo the King was defeated, therefore was this Statute made to ſupply that defect of the Common Law, by which Statute all the Lands he had at any time during his continuance in the Office were made lyable.</p>
               <p>And though it may be objected, That becauſe of this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the King is limited to a time, <hi>Viz.</hi> that inquiry ſhould be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:172213:130"/> made what Lands <hi>Havers</hi> had in the 20th year of the King, yet it was ſaid the Inquiry may be general.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elegit</hi> anciently left out the time, becauſe the Law doth determine from what time the party doth become lyable; ſo that the queſtion is about the King's Title, which if it appear to precede that of the Ter-tenant, then the King's Hands are not to be amoved; and thereupon Iudgment was prayed for him, <hi>Bro.

               <p>The Queſtion was if this Leaſe upon which no Rent was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but that of a Pepper Corn, be executed by the <hi>Statue of Uſes</hi> or not, if it be,<note place="margin">Cro.

               <p>But if this Leaſe be not within the Statute, becauſe no Vſe can be raiſed for want of a Conſideration, then it muſt be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance at the Common Law,<note place="margin">Lit. Sect. 465. Co. Lit. 46. b.</note> and ſo the Leſſee ought to make an actual Entry as was always uſual before the making of the Statute.</p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Waller</hi> and <hi>Maynard</hi> argued that here was no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to raiſe an Vſe, for the reſervation of a Pepper-Corn is no profit to the Leſſor, 'tis not a real and good Rent; For ſo ſmall and trivial a matter is no Conſideration, for that which muſt be a good Conſideration ought to be Mony, or ſome other valuable thing.</p>
               <p>Then this Conveyance is not executed by the Statute of Vſes, and if ſo 'tis not good at the Common Law, it being only a Leaſe for years, and no Entry, without which there can be no poſſeſſion, and if not then there can be no Reverſion upon which the Releaſe may operate, 'tis only an <hi>interreſſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> and ſo was the Opinion of my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſince the<note place="margin">Co.

               <p>The Words of the Leaſe are <hi>Demiſe, Grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> which are Words at the Common Law, <hi>Co.

                  <hi>Lutwitch</hi> and <hi>Mitton</hi> be objected, where it was reſolved by the two Chief Iuſtices and Chief Baron, that upon a Deed of Bargain and Sale of Lands, where the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee never entred, and the Bargainor reciting the Leaſe, did grant the Reverſion expectant upon it;<note place="margin">Cro.

               <p>This is no Objection to the purpoſe, becauſe in that Caſe the Bargainor was himſelf in actual poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>So that if there be no good Tenant to the Precipe in this Caſe, though all that joyn in it are Eſtopped to ſay ſo, yet the Tenant in Tail who comes in above, is not barred, <hi>5 H. 5. 9.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the othe ſide it was ſaid, that the Leſſee was in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion by the Statute, for the Word <hi>Grant</hi> being in the Leaſe, and the reſervation being a Pepper Corn, that will amount to a Bargain and Sale, though it hath not thoſe preciſe words in it, <hi>8 Co. 94.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iuſtice, At firſt when this ſort of Conveyance was uſed, the Leſſee upon the Leaſe for a year, did always make an actual Entry, and then came the Releaſe to convey the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but that being found troubleſome, the conſtant Practice was to make the Leaſe for a year, by the Deed of Bargain and Sale, for the conſideration of five ſhillings or ſome other ſmall ſum, and this was held and is ſo ſtill to be good without any actual Entry,<note place="margin">2 Cro. 604.</note> and the Bargaineé thereby is capable of a Releaſe (though he cannot bring an Action of Treſpaſs without Entry) for when Mony is the Conſideration of making the Bargain and Sale, 'tis executed by the Statute of Vſes, and ſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe upon it is good; but if the Deed be not executed, 'tis otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But this being to ſupport a Common Recovery,<note place="margin">Antea Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>and</hi> Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> was to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; and therefore the Court took time to conſider till the next Term; and then</p>
               <p>The Chief Iuſtice ſaid, That if a real Action be brought againſt <hi>A.</hi> who is not Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe,</hi> and a Recovery be had againſt him, the Sheriff can turn him out who is in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; but if he who is not in poſſeſſion comes in by Voucher, he is eſtopped to ſay afterwards that he was not party to the Writ, ſo that he who is bound muſt be Tenant or Vouchee, or claim under them.</p>
               <p>Conveyances have been altered, not ſo much by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Learned, as by the Ignorance of Vnskilful Men in their Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>The uſual Conveyance at Common Law, was by Feoffment, to which Livery and Seiſin were neceſſary, the Poſſeſſion being given thereby to the Feoffee;<note place="margin">Antea Lord <hi>Salisburies</hi> Caſe.</note> but if there was a Tenant in Poſſeſſion and ſo Livery could not be made, then the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was granted, and the particular Tenant always attorned, and upon the ſame reaſon it was that afterwards a Leaſe and Releaſe was held a good Conveyance to paſs an Eſtate, but at that time it was made no queſtion but that the Leſſee was to be in actual Poſſeſſion before the Releaſe.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Vſes came to be frequent, and Settlements to Vſes were very common, by reaſon whereof many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies were introduced, to prevent which the Statute of the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>H. 8.</hi> was made, by which the Vſe was united to the Poſſeſſion; for before that Statute Vſes were to be executed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Equity, but now they are reduced to the Common Law, and are of more certainty, and therefore are to be conſtrued according to the Rules of Law.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:172213:132"/>
               <p>At the Common Law when an Eſtate did not paſs by Feffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Leſſor or Vendor made a Leaſe for years, and the Leſſee actually entred, and then the Leſſor granted the Reverſion to another, and the Leſſee attorned, and this was good.</p>
               <p>Afterwards when an Inheritance was to be granted, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was a Leaſe for years uſually made, and the Leſſee entred as before, and then the Leſſor releaſed to him, and this was good.</p>
               <p>But after the Statute of Vſes, it became an Opinion, That if a Leaſe for years was made upon a valuable Conſideration, a Releaſe might operate upon that without an actual Entry of the Leſſee, becauſe the Statute did execute the Leaſe and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Vſe preſently to the Leſſee. Sir <hi>Francis Moor</hi> Serjeant at Law was the firſt who practiſed this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Nota.</note>But becauſe there were ſome Opinions that where Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances may enure two ways, the Common Law ſhall be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unleſs it appear that the party intended it ſhould paſs by the Statute, thereupon the uſual courſe was to put the Words <hi>Bargain and Sale</hi> into the Leaſe for a Year, to bring it within the Statute, and to alledge that the Leaſe was made to the intent and purpoſe that by the Statute of Vſes the Leſſee might be capable of a Releaſe; but notwithſtanding this, Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> was of the Opinion, That this Conveyance by Leaſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe could never be maintained without the actual Entry of the Leſſee.</p>
               <p>This Caſe goes farther than any that ever yet came into Iudgment, for Mony is not mentioned here to be the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or any thing which may amount to it, unleſs the Pepper Corn, which he held to be a good Conſideration.</p>
               <p>The Leaſe and Releaſe are but in nature of one Deed, and then the intent of the Parties is apparent that it ſhould paſs by the Satute, and <hi>eo inſtanti</hi> that the Leaſe is executed, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is in force.</p>
               <p>The Caſe put by <hi>Littleton</hi> in <hi>Sect. 459.</hi> is put at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and not upon the Statute; where he ſaith, That if a Leaſe be made for years, and the Leſſor releaſeth all his Right to the Leſſee before Entry, ſuch Releaſe is void, becauſe the Leſſee had only a Right and not the Poſſeſſion, which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Comment upon it, calls an <hi>intereſſe termini,</hi> and that ſuch Releaſe ſhall not enure to enlarge the Eſtate without the Poſſeſſion, which is very true at the Common Law, but not upon the Statute of Vſes.</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:172213:132"/>
               <p>And therefore Iudgment was given by the whole Court,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> that the Word <hi>Grant</hi> in the Leaſe will make the Land paſs by way of <hi>Uſe;</hi> that the Reſervation of a Pepper Corn was a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to raiſe an Vſe to ſupport a Common Recovery; that this Leaſe being within the Statute of Vſes, there was no need of an actual Entry to make the Leſſee capable of the Releaſe; for by vertue of the Statute he ſhall be adjudged to be in actual poſſeſſion, and ſo a good Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe;</hi> and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given accordingly in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term following.</p>

               <p>The Defendants juſtifie, for that the Plaintiff is Rector of the Rectory impropriate of <hi>B.</hi> and that the Chancel was out of Repair, and that the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> after Monition firſt given to the Plaintiff, had granted a Sequeſtration of the Tythes of the Rectory for the repairing the Chancel; and that the Defendants were Churchwardens of the Pariſh; and that the particulars mentioned in the Declaration were Tythes belonging to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff as Rector aforeſaid; and that by vertue of the ſaid Commiſſion they took the ſame for repairing of the ſaid Chancel, and that for theſe Tythes ſo taken they had accounted to the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>To this the Plaintiff demurred.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion was, whether an Impropriate Rectory be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Repairs of the Chancel by the Sequeſtration of the Tythes by the Biſhop; and thoſe who argued in the negative for the Plaintiff could not deny, but that Church Reparations did belong to the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and that as often as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions have been prayed to that Iurisdiction, Conſultations have been as often granted; notwithſtanding in many Caſes the Rates for ſuch Reparations have been very unequally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and the reaſon is becauſe thoſe Courts have original Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Matter.</p>
               <p>It was admitted alſo, that Pariſhioners are bound to repair the Church, and the Rector the Chappel, and in this reſpect of their Lands; and therefore if a Man hath Lands in one Town and dwell in another, he ſhall be contributory to the Reparation of that Church where his Lands are, and not where he inhabits.</p>
               <p>And that all this was by the common Cuſtom of <hi>England</hi> long before the making of the Statute of <hi>31 H. 8. cap. 13.</hi> by which Parſonages were made Lay Fees; but then it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that this was no real Duty incumbent upon them, but was a perſonal burden for which every Pariſhioner was chargeable proportionably to the quantity of Land which he held in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; in which Caſe if he refuſed to be contributory the Ordinary did never intermeddle with the poſſeſſions, but always proceeded by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, as Excommunication of the Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, which is the proper remedy.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:172213:133"/>
               <p>But in caſe of an Appropriation in the Hands of an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Corporation, as Dean and Chapter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there if a Refuſal be to contribute to the Repairs, the Ordinary may ſequeſter; and the reaſon is becauſe a Corporation cannot be excommunicated.</p>
               <p>The Ordinary may alſo ſequeſter in things of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance, as if the King do not preſent; ſo he may take the Profits within the ſix Months, that the Patron hath to preſent, and apply them to the Paſtor of the Church by him recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the Ordinary hath a proviſional Superintendency of the Church; and there is a neceſſity that the Cure ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed until the Patron doth preſent, and this is a kind of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration.</p>
               <p>But in ſome Caſes the Ordinary could not ſequeſter the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits belonging to Spiritual Perſons, though he was lawfully entituled to them for a particular time and purpoſe: For by the Statute of <hi>13 Eliz. cap. 20.</hi> 'tis Enacted, <hi>That if a Parſon make a Leaſe of his Living for a longer time than he is reſident upon it, that ſuch Leaſe ſhall be void, and he ſhall for the ſame loſe one years Profits of his Benefice, to be diſtributed by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary amongſt the Poor of the Pariſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he had no Remedy to recover the Years Profits, but in the Eccleſiaſtical Court; he could not ſequeſter, and to give him Authority ſo to do a ſupplemental Statute was made five years afterwards in the <hi>18th</hi> year of the Queens Reign <hi>cap. 11.</hi> by which Power is given him to grant a Sequeſtration; ſo that if he could not ſequeſter in a Caſe of which he had a Iurisdiction by a precedent Statute, <hi>à fortiori</hi> he cannot in a Caſe exempted as this is from his Iurisdiction.</p>
               <p>But admitting a Sequeſtration might go, then this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency would follow, that if other Lands ſhould be ſequeſtred for the ſame purpoſe, the former Sequeſtration could not be pleaded to diſcharge them, becauſe the intereſt is not bound thereby, no more than a Sequeſtration out of <hi>Chancery</hi> is pleadable to an Action of Treſpaſs at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>This Caſe cannot be diſtinguiſhed from that of <hi>Jefferies</hi> in <hi>5 Co.</hi> and from what the Civilians teſtified to the Court there, <hi>viz. That the Churchwardens and greater part of the Pariſhioners upon a general warning given may make a Taxation by Law, but the ſame ſhall not charge the Land, but the perſon in reſpect of his Land;</hi> ſo that 'tis he that is chargeable and may be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in caſe of refuſal to contribute, but his Lands cannot be ſequeſtred, becauſe 'tis not the buſineſs of the Ordinary to meddle with the temporal poſſeſſions of Lay-men, but to proceed againſt them by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures; and the Pariſhioners
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:172213:134"/> Lands may be as well ſequeſtred for the Repairs of the Church, as the Lands of the Impropriator for the Repairs of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for which Reaſons it was held that a Sequeſtration would not lie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note>But on the other ſide it was ſaid, that before the making of the Statute the Rector was to repair the Chancel under pain of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration, which the Ordinary had power to grant in caſe of refuſal; and that his Authority in many Caſes was not abridged by the Statute: The Caſe of<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cro. 518.</note> 
                  <hi>Parry <hi>and</hi> Banks</hi> was cited, where in the <hi>24th</hi> Year of <hi>H. 8.</hi> a Parſonage was appropriated to the Deanary of St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> and a Vicaridge endowed, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop diſſolved in the <hi>24th</hi> Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Parry</hi> pretending that notwithſtanding this Diſſolution it was in the Kings Hands by lapſe obtained a Preſentation; and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that after the Statute of Diſſolutions, which made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages Lay Fees, the Ordinary could not diſſolve the Vicaridge where the Parſonage was in a Temporal Hand, but being in that Caſe in the Hands of the Dean, he might.</p>
               <p>The Rector is to repair the Chancel, becauſe of the Profits of the Glebe, which is therefore <hi>Onus reale impoſitum rebus &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonis;</hi> and of that Opinion was <hi>Johannes de Atkin,</hi> who wrote <hi>100</hi> years before <hi>Lynwood,</hi> where in <hi>fol. 56.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That if the Chancel was out of repair it affected the Glebe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Conſtitution of the Canon Law is ſuch will not be denied,<note place="margin">Vaugh. 327.</note> and if ſo Canons being allowed, are by uſe become parcel of the Common Law, and are as much the Law of the Kingdom as an Act of Parliament, for what is Law doth not <hi>ſuſcipere magis aut minus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several Caſes were put where the Biſhop doth intermeddle with the Profits of a Parſonage, as in the Caſe of a Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration upon a Iudgment obtained againſt a Spiritual Perſon, where a <hi>Fi. Fa.</hi> is directed to the Sheriff upon that Iudgment, and he returns <hi>Clericus beneficiatus non habens Laicum feodum;</hi> for which reaſon he cannot meddle with the Profits of the Glebe, but the Biſhop doth it by a Sequeſtration to him directed.</p>
               <p>He may likewiſe retain for the ſupply of the Cure and pay only the reſidue, which hath been omitted on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>As the Ordinary might diſſolve a Vicaridge endowed where the Parſonage was in the Hands of a Dean, ſo he may ſequeſter an Appropriation in any Spiritual Perſon; and there is no Statute which exempts an Impropriation from ſuch a Sequeſtration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis <hi>onus reale</hi> at the Common Law; and as the Lay Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriator may ſue for Tythes and receive them as before the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:172213:134"/> making this Statute; 'tis as reaſonable ſince he hath the ſame advantage that he ſhould have the ſame Charge, and the rather becauſe the ſaving in the Statute of <hi>31 H. 8. cap. 13.</hi> doth ſtill continue the ſame Authority the Biſhop had before, though the poſſeſſion was thereby given to the King.</p>
               <p>The Words of which are, <hi>viz. Saving to all and every perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch Right which they might have had as if the Act had not been made,</hi> which muſt be the Right of the Ordinary and of no other perſon.</p>
               <p>An Impropriator pays Synodals and Procurations as well as an Appropriation in the Hands of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, and it would be very inconvenient if a Sequeſtration ſhould not lie which would quicken them more than an Excommunication; and it was ſaid, that in <hi>England</hi> there were above <hi>1000</hi> Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations belonging to Corporations aggregate, as Deans and Chapters, which could not be excommunicated; and if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop could not ſequeſter, then there was no remedy to repair the Chancel: For which Reaſons Iudgment was prayed for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>But the whole Court, beſides Iuſtice <hi>Atkins,</hi> held that the Lay Impropriation was not to be ſequeſtred for the Repairs of the Chancel: And the Chief Iuſtice ſaid, that the Repair of the Chancel was an Eccleſiaſtical Cauſe, but that the Rectory and Impropriator were Lay, and not to be ſequeſtred as the poſſeſſions in the Hands of Eccleſiaſtical Corporations may, which he did agree could not be excommunicated, but the perſons who made up ſuch Corporation might.</p>
               <p>And as to the Sequeſtration upon a Iudgment it made nothing for the Matter to entitle the Ordinary to a Sequeſtration in this Caſe, becauſe what he doth in that is in the nature of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Officer; for the Sequeſtration is like the <hi>Fieri Facias,</hi> and being directed to the Biſhop, he is in that Caſe (if he may be ſo called) an Eccleſiaſtical Sheriff, and by virtue thereof may do as the Sheriff doth in other Caſes, that is, he may ſeiſe Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical things and ſell them, as the Sheriff doth Temporal things upon a <hi>Fieri Facias;</hi> but 'tis to be obſerved that he muſt return <hi>Fieri feci,</hi> and not <hi>Sequeſtrari feci</hi> upon this Writ.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Saving</hi> in the Statute, that doth not alter the Caſe; for if any Right be thereby ſaved, 'tis that of the Parſon, for the Pariſhioners have no right to ſit there; indeed the Vicar may, becauſe he comes in under the Parſon.</p>
               <p>So that this Caſe is not to be put as at the Common Law, but upon the Statute of Diſſolutions, by vertue whereof the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:172213:135"/> Rectory being in the Hands of a Lay Perſon is become a Lay Fee, and ſo cannot be ſubject to a Sequeſtration; if it ſhould, the next ſtep would be that the Biſhop would increaſe Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges as well in the Caſe of an Impropriation as Appropriation, which would leſſen the poſſeſſions of ſuch as have purchaſed under the Act.</p>
               <p>But Iuſtice <hi>Atkins</hi> was of a contrary Opinion; he ſaid that it was agreed by all that an Impropriator is chargeable with the Repairs of the Chancel; but the Charge was not perſonal but in regard of the profits of the Impropriation, which are originally the Debtor according to the firſt Donation. That the primary Rights of Rectories are the performance of Divine Service and the Repairs of the Chancel, and that the Profits, which are over and above, muſt then go to the Imprpriator, and are to be eſteemed then a Lay Fée; but that thoſe Duties are the firſt Rights, and therefore muſt be firſt diſcharged.</p>
               <p>That this Right, this duty of Repairing was certain, and therefore ſhall not be taken away by Implication, but by expreſs Words in the Act, which if wanting ſhall remain ſtill, and the Parties ſhall be compelled to repair under the ſame Penalties as before.</p>
               <p>But admitting it ſhould be taken away, yet the <hi>ſaving</hi> in the Act extends to the Right of the Pariſhioners, which is not to ſit in the Chancel, but to go thither when the Sacraments are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, of which they are deprived, when 'tis out of Repair; nor can they have the uſe of the Church which properly belongs to them, becauſe when the Chancel is out of Repair it not only defaces the Church, but makes it in a ſhort time become rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
               <p>He denied that a Sequeſtration in <hi>Chancery</hi> cannot be pleaded to barr a Treſpaſs at the Common Law; for if it be ſaid that the <hi>Chancery</hi> have iſſued ſuch Sequeſtrations it will be as binding as any other Proceſs iſſuing according to the Rules of the Common Law.</p>
               <p>And he alſo denied the Caſe put by the Chief Iuſtice, that the Lands of the Pariſhioners might as well be ſequeſtred for the repair of the Church as thoſe of the Impropriator for repair of the Chancel, becauſe the Profits of the Rectory might originally be ſequeſtred, but the Lands of the Pariſhioner could not; and ſo the Caſes are quite different.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Judgment.</note>But in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term following Iudgment was given againſt the Defendant upon the point of Pleading, which the Court all agreed to be ill.</p>

               <p>He ſaid that at the Common Law the Proceſs in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> was <hi>Summons, Pone,</hi> and <hi>Diſtreſs infinite,</hi> which being found miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in reſpect of a Lapſe, it was therefore provided by this Statute, that if the diſturbers do not appear upon the Summons, then they ſhall be Attached to appear at another day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now here upon the Attachment the Sheriff hath returned <hi>Attachiatus fuit</hi> by <hi>John Doe</hi> and <hi>Richard Roe,</hi> who are feigned perſons, and not <hi>mainpernors;</hi> for the Defendant hath made Oath, That he did not know any ſuch perſons, neither was he ever Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that 'tis not only a matter of Form, for he ought to have that notice which the Law requires, it being ſo penal upon him.</p>
               <p>'Tis probable this Miſtake might ariſe from Mr. <hi>Dalton,</hi> who in his Book of the <hi>Office of Sheriffs,</hi> in the Returns of Writs there, hath put down theſe feigned Attachers for Examples ſake, from whence the Sheriff in this Caſe might inferr that they need not be real perſons, as in truth they ought, both upon the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Pone,</hi> and <hi>Diſtreſs;</hi> and he cited a Caſe lately adjudged, where the like Return was made upon the Grand Cape, and the Iudgment ſet aſide; and of this Opinion was the whole Court, and ſaid, Where the Proceſs is ſo fatal, the Party ought to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:172213:138"/> be duly ſerved, and that the Sheriff ought to have gone to the Church and to have ſeiſed the Profits; and if there be nothing, to return a <hi>Nihil;</hi> and though the Iudgment was given before the Term, or long ſince, yet when 'tis Irregular 'tis to be ſet aſide, and ſo it was now; and being moved again, the Court continued of their former Opinion.</p>

               <p>But on the other ſide it was objected, that leaving due notice upon the Summons was as much as was required, for the other Writs are only to give the Defendant time to plead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not neceſſary that notice ſhould be given upon every one of the Writs, for if once ſerved 'tis enough, <hi>11 H. 6. 3, 4. 36 H. 6. 23. 8 H. 6. 8.

               <p>But the Court were of Opinion that the Defendant having not appeared, nor caſt an Eſſoign, and Iudgment final being given,<note place="margin">Curia.</note> it was reaſon that all the Proceſs ſhould be ſerved really, of which there had been no occaſion, if he had either appeared or eſſoined, and therefore the Proceſs not being duly ſerved Iudgment was ſet aſide, <hi>Raſt.

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:172213:144"/> well diſcloſe the matter of Law in Pleading, which is a much cheaper way than to have a Special Verdict, and that this is on the ſame reaſon of giving of colour; but if the matter by which the Defendant juſtifies, be all matter of Fact and proper for the Tryal of a Iury, then the Dfendant ought to plead the General Iſſue.</p>
               <p>And as to the Matter of the Plea, the Chief Iuſtice and <hi>Wyndham</hi> Iuſtice held it to be good; for the Common which was pleaded was a Common by Grant and not argumentatively plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if the Defendant had pleaded an expreſs Grant of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in thoſe two places, and the Plaintiff had demanded Oyer of the Deed, it would have appeared that there was no ſuch Deed, and this had been a good cauſe of Demurrer.</p>
               <p>If this Plea ſhould not be good it would be very miſchievous to the Defendant; for there being a perpetual Vnity, as to the Freehold there can be no Preſcription to the Common; but there being a conſtant enjoyment thereof by the Tenants, and ſo a perpetual Vſage and a Grant made referring to that Vſage, 'tis well enough: And ſince, whilſt the Lands were in poſſeſſion of the Lord, the Commoners could not complain of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; why ſhould they, if he grant the Premiſſes, the Granteé being <hi>in loco, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Caſe of the King a Grant of <hi>tot &amp; talia Libertates &amp; Privilegia quot &amp; qualia</hi> the Abbot lately had,<note place="margin">9 Co. 23. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>de Strata Marcella.</hi>
                  </note> was held good by ſuch general Words: Here the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> granted to the Defendant that which the Leſſées had before, <hi>viz.</hi> that Common which the Tenants had time out of mind; and it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but that the Tenants had a Right; for as a <hi>Tort</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſumed to be from time immemorial, ſo neither ſhall it be intended that the Lord gave only a Licence, and permitted his Tenants to enjoy this Common.</p>
               <p>But Iuſtice <hi>Atkins</hi> was of Opinion that the Plea was not good; he ſaid, he knew not by what Name to call this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; for it was no more than a Permiſſion from the Lord, that the Tenants might put their Cattle into his Freehold, or a Connivance at them for ſo doing; and if it be taken as a new Grant, then nothing can paſs, but the Surplus; for the Lord cannot derogate from his former Grant, and the new Grantee ſhall not put in an equal proportion with him who hath the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; for if he may, then ſuch Preſcription would be quite deſtroyed by ſuch <hi>puiſne</hi> Grant; for as the Lord might grant to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:172213:145"/> one, ſo he might to twenty, and then there would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Common left for him, who preſcribes to the Right: So that he conceived that the Defendant had no Right of Common, or if he had any, it would not be till after the Right of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff was ſerved; and he ſaid that Vſage ſhall not intend a Right, but it may be an Evidence of it upon a Tryal.</p>
               <p>But if there had been an Vſage 'tis now loſt by the Vnity of the Poſſeſſion, and ſhall not be revived by the new Grant, like the Caſe of <hi>Maſſam <hi>and</hi> Hunter;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Yelv. 189.</note> there was a Copyholder of a Meſſuage and two Acres in Feé, which the Lord afterwards granted and confirmed to him in Fee <hi>cum pertinentiis,</hi> it was adjudged that though the Tenant by Vſage had a Right to have Common in the Lord's Waſt, yet by this new Grant and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation that Right was gone (the Copyhold being thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed;) for the Common being by Vſage and now loſt, theſe Words <hi>cum pertinentiis</hi> in the new Grant will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it.</p>

               <p>The Defendant pleaded that on the 24th day of <hi>April</hi> in the 26th year of King <hi>Charles the Second</hi> he paid the Plaintiff 6 <hi>d.</hi> which he received in full ſatisfaction of all Treſpaſſes <hi>uſque ad</hi> the ſaid 24th day of <hi>April, abſque hoc</hi> that he was guilty <hi>ad aliquod aliud tempus praeter praedictum</hi> 24 <hi>Aprilis anno</hi> 26 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>aut aliquo tempore poſtea,</hi> but leaveth out the 24th day of <hi>April;</hi> and for that Reaſon the Plaintiff demurred, becauſe the Defendant had not anſwered that day, for the Word <hi>uſque</hi> excludes it.</p>

               <p>To this Plea the Plaintiffs demurred, and had Iudgment in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and a Writ of Inquiry of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages was Executed, and <hi>750 l.</hi> Damages given; and it was alledged that the Defendant could not move to ſet aſide the Iudgment in that Term it was given, becauſe the Writ of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was executed the laſt day of the Term, and the Court did immediatly riſe; and that he could not move the next Term, becauſe the Iudgment was given the Term before the Writ of Error was brought.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Attorny General</hi> therefore ſaid that this was a hard Caſe, and deſired a Note of the Exceptions to the Plea, which he would endeavour to maintain, which Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> gave him, and then he deſired time to anſwer them.</p>
               <p>The Exception to the Plea upon which the Iudgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was this;</p>

               <p>So that the Point was,<note place="margin">Cro. Car. 205. 2 Sid. 151. 1 Roll.

               <p>It was ſaid that in ſome Caſes a Surrender into the Hands of a Diſſeiſor was good, that is, when the Surrender is made to him to the uſe of another and his Heirs, and he admits him, there the perſon admitted claims not under the Lord, but under the Copyholder, who made the Surrender;<note place="margin">1 Inſt. 59. b.</note> for nothing paſſes to the Lord, but only to ſerve the Limitation of the Vſe, 1 <hi>Rol.

               </p>
               <p>But in this Caſe the Grantée muſt claim from the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not from the Copyholder, becauſe he had but an Eſtate for his own Life, with which he wholly departed when he made the Surrender to the uſe of the Diſſeiſor himſelf.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Trinity-Term</hi> following this Caſe was argued by Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Surrenders of a Copyhold.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Proper.</item>
                  <item>2. Formal and Ceremonious.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If a Surrender be to the Lord to the uſe of another, this is no proper Surrender; for no Eſtate paſſeth to the Lord he being only the Inſtrument to convey it to the Surrendree, and this is but nominal.</p>
               <p>But here the Surrender was to the uſe of the Lord himſelf, which is a proper Surrender, and in ſuch Caſe 'tis neceſſary that the Lord have a Reverſion, for one Eſtate is to be turned into the other, and there muſt be a continuing of Eſtates.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Dominus pro tempore,</hi> who is a Diſſeiſor hath no ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: <hi>Executor de ſon tort</hi> ſhall ſue, but he cannot retain.</p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:172213:150"/>
               <p>If therefore he is not capable to take a Surrender to himſelf, unleſs he hath ſuch an Eſtate, then here is no Diſſeiſin of the Copyhold, 'tis only of the Mannor; and then no greater Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt paſſeth to the Diſſeiſor than to a Stranger, whilſt the true Lord had been in poſſeſſion, for ſo he is <hi>quoad</hi> this Copyhold if he was not diſſeiſed of it; for if the Copyholder had the poſſeſſion there could be then no Diſſeiſin; if he was out of poſſeſſion then he had nothing but a Right, and that cannot be ſurrendred, for it muſt be an Eſtate; as if a Leſſee for years keep poſſeſſion, 'tis the poſſeſſion of the Lord, and the Law is the ſame in caſe of a Copyhold, 2 <hi>Co. Bettiſworth's Caſe.</hi>

                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iuſtice and <hi>Wyndham</hi> enclined that the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was not good; for it was a material diſtinction where the Surrender was made to the uſe of a Stranger, and where it terminates in the Lord; that a Surrender made by a Copyhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Life could not transfer, but extinguiſh his Right; for he could not give a greater Eſtate than he had; that there muſt be a Reverſion in the Lord to make a Surrender to him to be good; and that if a Copyholder keeps in poſſeſſion there could be no Diſſeiſin.</p>
               <p>But Iuſtice <hi>Atkins contra.</hi> That this Surrender muſt have operation to extinguiſh his Right; for though a Copyholder for Life cannot ſurrender for longer time than his own Life; yet if a Surrender be made of ſuch a Copyhold to an Vſe 'tis good, and works by way of Extinguiſhment of his Right though the Vſe be void; and if a Copyholder of Inheritance ſurrender to a Diſſeiſor, <hi>ut faciat voluntatem,</hi> who regrants to the ſaid Copyholder an Eſtate in Tail according to the Surrender, this ſhall bind the Diſſeiſee, 1 <hi>Roll.

               <p>The Copyholder in this Caſe might have ſold his Eſtate to the Diſſeiſor, and it had béen good; and though the Acts of a Diſſeiſor ſhall not prejudice the Diſſeiſee, yet he could ſee no reaſon why the Copyholder, who had parted with his Eſtate, ſhould have it again.</p>

                  <hi>Richard Ben</hi> deviſed theſe Lands to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Siſter and Heir, for ſo long time, and until her Son <hi>Benjamin Wharton</hi> ſhould attain his full Age of <hi>21</hi> years; and after he ſhall have attained his ſaid Age, then to the ſaid <hi>Benjamin</hi> and his Heirs for ever; and if he dye before his Age of <hi>21</hi> years, then to the Heirs of the Body of <hi>Robert Wharton</hi> and to their Heirs for ever as they ſhould attain their reſpective Ages of <hi>21</hi> years.</p>

               <p>There is a difference between <hi>Boraſton's Caſe</hi> and this at the Barr; for that was a Deviſe to Executors till <hi>Hugh</hi> ſhall attain his Age of <hi>21</hi> years, and the mean Profits in the mean time to be applyed by them for payment of the Teſtators Debts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might have computed how long it would be before his Debts could be paid; therefore it was adjudged that after the death of <hi>Hugh</hi> within Age, the Executors ſhould continue in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion till <hi>Hugh</hi> might have attained his full Age had he lived, and ſo a preſent Deviſe to them.</p>
               <p>But here the Deviſe is generally till <hi>Benjamin Wharton</hi> ſhall attain his Age of <hi>21</hi> years, ſo that nothing veſted in him until that time, and he dying before, then the Eſtate ſhall deſcend to the general Heir, who is the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>So here the Fee deſcends to <hi>Benjamin Wharton</hi> in poſſeſſion, and he dying without Iſſue and within Age, the Land ſhall then deſcend to his Siſter and Heir.</p>
               <p>The like Iudgment was given in the Caſe of <hi>Taylor <hi>and</hi> Wharton</hi> about <hi>12</hi> years ſince; and in <hi>Dyer 124. a.</hi> A Deviſe to his Wife till his Son ſhall be of the Age of <hi>24</hi> years, then to the Son in Fee; and if he die before <hi>24</hi> years without Iſſue, then to the Wife for Life, the Remainder to <hi>A. &amp;c.</hi> The Teſtator dyed,<note place="margin">2 Leon. 11. pl. 16.

               <p>In this Caſe <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had a Term till <hi>Benjamin Wharton</hi> be of Age, for ſhe is Executrix; ſhe was likewiſe Heir at Law to the Deviſor, and this Land had gone to her, had it not béen for this Will; ſo that 'tis plain the Teſtator never intended that a Fee-ſimple ſhould veſt in her, but ſomewhere elſe; for he could never intend the Deſcent of the Inheritance to that perſon to whom he had deviſed the Term.</p>
               <p>It has beén argued, that <hi>Mary</hi> is Heir at Law to <hi>Benjamin</hi> as well as Heir of the Body of <hi>Robert,</hi> and ſo if ſhe can take either way 'tis good; but to make her Heir to <hi>Benjamin</hi> 'tis neceſſary that the Eſtate veſt in him before he comes to <hi>21</hi> years; and for that <hi>Boraſton's Caſe</hi> was much relyed on, which was alſo ſaid not to differ from this at the Barr; that an Eſtate paſſes to <hi>Benjamin Wharton in praeſenti,</hi> and that there was no Incapacity for <hi>Mary</hi> to take by way of Executory Deviſe, as was urged on the other ſide, and therefore why ſhould ſhe not take by way of Executory Deviſe as Heir of the Body of her Father, or at leaſt, as Heir of <hi>Benjamin</hi> her Brother?</p>
               <p>An Executory Deviſe needs no particular Eſtate to ſupport it, for it ſhall deſcend to the Heir till the Contingency happen; 'tis not like a Remainder at the Common Law, which muſt veſt <hi>eo inſtanti</hi> that the particular Eſtate determines; but the Learning of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutory Deviſes ſtands upon the Reaſons of the old Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the intent of the Deviſor is to be obſerved: For when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Will that he intends not the Deviſee to take but in <hi>futuro,</hi> and no diſpoſition being made thereof in the mean time, it ſhall then deſcend to the Heir till the Contingency happen; but if the intent be that he ſhall take <hi>in praeſenti,</hi> and there is no incapacity in him to do it, he ſhall not take <hi>in futuro</hi> by an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory Deviſe.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> for the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> That a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Law is to be ſued only in the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> and not elſewhere, becauſe there is an abſolute neceſſity of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance there: He is ſworn, and no other perſon can plead at that Bar, and therefore if he ſhould be ſued in any other Court,<note place="margin">Vaugh. 155.</note> it would be an Impediment to the Buſineſs of that Court, where not only the Officers but their Servants have Priviledge.</p>
               <p>In the 11th of <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. There was ſome diſcourſe about the Priviledge of Serjeants at Law, where it was held that he is not to be ſued in that Court by Bill, but by Original; but either way he is to have his Priviledge. So the Servant of an Officer is not to be ſued by Bill,<note place="margin">Cro. Car. 84.</note> but he is ſtill to have the Priviledge of the Court, and ſo had Serjeant <hi>Hedley</hi>'s Clerk in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt.</p>
               <p>The Serjeants receive a kind of Induction to the Bar, and have a place aſſigned them; and that they ought to have Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, the very Words of the Writ are obſervable, <hi>Viz.</hi> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning a Serjeant at Law) <hi>ex officio incumbit in Curia illa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though it hath been ſaid and given as an anſwer to that Caſe in <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> That where the Serjeants Clerk was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in an Inferior Court (as in that Caſe he was) there he ſhall have Priviledge, but not againſt the other great Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall; this is a difference never yet taken notice of in any Book, nor doth the Writ warrant this diſtinction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſhall have his Priviledge though he be joyned with another, becauſe the Action is joynt and ſeveral; and the one may be found guilty and the other acquitted, and it would be an eaſie way to ouſt a Man of his Priviledge, if it might be done by joyning him with another who hath none, 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 21.</p>
               <p>But the Perſon with whom the Serjeant is joyned may be ſued in the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> likewiſe, ſo that he ſhall not hinder him from having Priviledge who of right ought to have it, 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Offley contra.</hi> As to the firſt point,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> agreed, that a Serjeant at Law ſhall always have the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> againſt all Inferiour Courts, but not againſt the other Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, for he may be ſued in any of them.</p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:172213:155"/>
               <p>A Serjeant is not like the Common Officers of the Court, for they are to be attendant there and no where elſe; but a Serjeant at Law is not confined to that Court alone, he may be aſſigned of Council in any other Court, and doth uſually put his hand to Pleas, both in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer;</hi> but a Philazer or Attorny of that Court cannot practiſe in his own Name in any other.</p>
               <p>All Caſes of Priviledge ought to be taken ſtrictly: And that which was cited concerning the Priviledge of a Serjeants Clerk is not like this, becauſe the Arreſt was in an Inferiour Court.</p>
               <p>In the 11 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>b.</hi> The Chief Iuſtice of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> came to the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> Bar, and told a Serjeant who he had aſſigned for a <hi>Pauper,</hi> That if he would not come into that Court and plead for his Clyent, he would forejudge him; ſo that if he could be fetch'd out of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> and carried to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> he is not confined to that Court alone.</p>
               <p>In the 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>nu.</hi> 10. Complaint was made that the Subjects of the King were not well ſerved in his Courts, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereupon Ordered, that one <hi>Martin</hi> and others ſhould take upon them the Dignity of Serjeants at Law, ſo that it appears that their Buſineſs lies in other Courts as well as in that of the <hi>Common-Pleas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond Point: Here is a joynt Action, for any thing that appears to the contrary,<note place="margin">2 Rol.

               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Read</hi> was made High Sheriff of <hi>Hartfordſhire, 12 No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb. 25 Car. 2.</hi> and being ſtill under the Sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, he took upon him the Office and executed it for <hi>3 Months, viz.</hi> to the <hi>12th</hi> day of <hi>February</hi> afterwards, and then refuſed to ſerve any longer; the Iudges came ſoon after to keep the Aſſiſes for that County, but there was no Sheriff there to attend them, and the reaſon was, becauſe if he had executed the Office without taking the Oaths (the time being now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, wherein he ought to have taken the ſame,) then he had ſubjected himſelf to the forfeiture of <hi>500 l.</hi> and he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament becauſe he was Excommunicated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſed that after the <hi>3 Months</hi> he was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſcharged by the aforeſaid Statute; and whether upon all this matter the Defendant be guilty was the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ward</hi> and Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> the Attorny General argued that the Defendant was Guilty.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Oath and Sacrament are neceſſary qualifications for all Sheriffs, becauſe the Act appoints theſe things to be done, and the Penalty therein extends to thoſe who execute any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice after the three Months, without doing the ſame, but not to ſuch who neglect to qualifie themſelves.</p>
               <p>And though it may be objected, that the Act gives no Penalty for not taking of the Oath, it only enjoyns it to be done, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

Then as to the Subſtance;</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Information is inſufficient, for there is no Offence at all of which the Common Law doth take notice; and though the Conſequences of the thing done may be bad, yet no Man ſhall be puniſhed for that, becauſe thoſe only aggravate the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if any; neither is this Information true, for it ſaith he refuſed <hi>abſque rationabili cauſa,</hi> but here was a reaſonable cauſe: And though it may be objected, that it was only <hi>impotentia volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis;</hi> and that every Subject being disabled, is to remove that diſability to ſerve the King, this was denied; for a Man who is a Priſoner for Debt is not bound or compellable to be She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, neither is a Man bound to purchaſe Lands to qualifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be either a Coroner or Iuſtice of the Peace. By the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>3 Jac.</hi> every Recuſant is diſabled; he may conform, but he is not bound to it, for if he ſubmits to the Pemalty, 'tis as much as is required by Law: 'Tis true, a Subject is bound to ſerve the King in ſuch capacity as he is in at the time of the Service commanded, but he is not obliged to qualifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſerve in every capacity: Neither doth it appear in this Caſe, that the Defendant was able to remove this Incapacity, and that ſhould have been ſhewn on the other ſide, and all Iudges are to judge upon the Record.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:172213:157"/>
               <p>The intent of the Statute is, That if perſons will not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie themſelves, they ſhall not execute any Office, and it was made to keep Roman Catholicks out of Places, but not to force them to accept of Offices of Truſt in the Government; and it deſigns no puniſhment for quitting, but for executing of a place contrary to the Law; but if this be an Offence, this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not lie; and for that</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> It was argued, That if a thing be either commanded or forbidden by a Statute, the tranſgreſſion in either Caſe is an Offence puniſhable by Information;<note place="margin">25 H 6. pl. 9. b. 7 H. 4. 5.</note> but when an Act doth not generally command a thing, but only <hi>ſub modo,</hi> the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending is puniſhable no otherwiſe than deſigned by that Law; as where the Statute of <hi>18 H. 6. cap. 11.</hi> prohibits any Man from being a Iuſtice of the Peace, unleſs he have <hi>40 l. ꝑ An<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> and the Statute of <hi>5 &amp; 6 E. 6. cap. 16.</hi> which makes ſuch Bargains as are therein mentioned about buying of Offices void, if ſuch Office be forfeitable, then an Information will lie; but when 'tis <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void, as in both the former Caſes, then 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, becauſe the puniſhment is executed by the Statute it ſelf; and therefore where the avoidance is made by the Act, there is no need of an Information.</p>
               <p>And the Objection of <hi>impotentia voluntatis</hi> is not material to this purpoſe, becauſe Symony, buying of Offices, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the <hi>39</hi> Articles, according to the Statute of the Queen; theſe are all voluntary Acts, yet no Information lies againſt ſuch Offenders, becauſe the Statutes execute the puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The intent of the Parliament is here declared, the diſability of the perſon makes the Office void; void to all intents, for the Right of Infants or Men in Priſon is not ſaved; ſo that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to be an Offence, if the Duty be not performed; yet if ſuch a qualification be requiſit to make a Man to act in ſuch an Office, or perform ſuch a Duty, if that qualification be wanting, the Party is only puniſhable by the loſs of the Office.</p>
               <p>The Act doth not diſtinguiſh between Offices of Truſt and Profit: And as to the other Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis in the power of the Defendant to qualifie himſelf, the ſame might as well be objected againſt all the Popiſh Recuſants, upon the Statute of <hi>3 Jac.</hi> and if a Statute doth diſable perſons or abridge the King of their Services, there is no injury done, becauſe the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is party to the Act; but if miſchiefs were never ſo great, ſince they are introduced by a Law, they cannot be avoided till that Law is changed.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> But admitting the Information to be good, and that this is an Offence for which it will lie, yet the Excommunication is a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:172213:157"/> ſufficient excuſe; it appears by the Verdict that the Defendant was abſolutely diſabled to be Sheriff, for if he is to take the Oath and receive the Sacrament in order to it, if he cannot be admitted to the Sacrament, as being under the Sentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, that is an excuſe.</p>
               <p>The Defendant is only argued into a Guilt, for the Iury have not found any; they do not ſay, that it was in his power to yield Obedience, or that he might have enabled himſelf; they only find his incapacity, and though it was a voluntary Act, which was the cauſe of his diſability, yet in ſuch Caſes the Law doth not look to Cauſes ſo remote. If a Man be in Priſon for Debt it is his own Act for contracting it and not paying, but yet an Outlary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him whilſt in Priſon ſhall be reverſed, becauſe the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Impriſonment; and the Iudgment was <hi>in invitum,</hi> and the Law looks no farther; and ſo Iudgment was prayed for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>But the Court were all of Opinion, that this Information would lye, and that the Defendant was puniſhable for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the diſability, it being in his power to get himſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from the Excommunication: And ſo Iudgment was given againſt him, and a Writ of Error brought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>TReſpaſs for breaking of his Cloſe.

That the ſaid <hi>Martin</hi> granted ſome of the Trees to the Defendant, by virtue whereof he and the reſt of his Servants did cut them down, which is the ſame breaking of the Cloſe of which the Plaintiff complains: To which Plea Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> did demurr for the Inſufficiency, becauſe the Defendant did not ſhew, that upon cutting down the Trees he did repair the Hedges, as by the Agreement ought to have been done; for this being a limited and qualified power ought to be ſet forth at large; and that it was a power only annexed to the Reverſion and not aſſignable to any one elſe, and ſo the Defendant hath wholly failed in his Plea; he might have juſtified under <hi>Martin,</hi> but not in any of their own Rights.</p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:172213:165"/>
               <p>But the Court were of Opinion, That an Action doth lie in this Caſe, both againſt the Leſſor and his Aſſignee, acting under his Power; and they agreed that a bare power was not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignable; but where 'tis coupled with an Intereſt, it may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and here was an Intereſt annexed to the power; for the Leſſor might ſever the Trees from the Reverſion.

               <p>But the Court held the Declaration to be defective in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe a Preſcription cannot be annexed to any thing but an Eſtate in Fee, and therefore 'tis not helped after Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. The Iudgment was reverſed.</p>

               <p>The Plaintiff did afterwards bring an Action of Trover and Converſion for the ſame Cattle, and the Defendant pleaded the former Iudgment in Treſpaſs, in barr to this Action of Trover, and the Plaintiff demurred.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:172213:165"/>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> argued, That the Plea was not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Treſpaſs and Trover are diſtinct Actions, and one may be where the other is not; as, if an Infant give Goods to one, an Action of Trover doth lie to recover them, but Treſpaſs will not: So if Goods be delivered to another, and he refuſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them upon demand, Trover, but not Treſpaſs will lie; and therefore theſe being different Actions, a Recovery in one ſhall be no barr to the other.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Formedon</hi> brought in the <hi>Deſcender,</hi> and Iudgment thereon, is not pleadable in barr to a <hi>Formedon</hi> in <hi>Remainder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a great difference between a barr to the Action,<note place="margin">5 Co. 33.6 Co. 37. a. Cro. El. 667. Eo. Entr. 38. b. 2 Cro. 15. pl. 20. Antea.</note> and to the Right; as where an Adminiſtrator ſues, not knowing that he was made Executor, and Iudgment againſt him; and he afterwards proved the Will, and brought an Action as Executor; the former Iudgment had againſt him as Adminiſtrator ſhall not be a barr to this new Action, becauſe 'tis not a barr to the Right, for by miſconceiving his Action the former abated.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> argued, That theſe were Actions of the ſame nature, and therfore a Iudgment in one was a good Plea in barr to the other; Treſpaſs or Trover lies for taking or carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Goods of another, and when he hath made his Election which to bring, a Recovery there ſhall be a perpetual barr to the other.</p>
               <p>In an Appeal of <hi>Mayhem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 Co. 39.</note> the Defendant pleaded a former Recovery in an Action of Aſſault and Battery, and held good; though one is of a higher nature than the other.</p>
               <p>But the Court were of Opinion,<note place="margin">Curia. Roſe <hi>and</hi> Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Antea.</note> That an Action of Trover doth lie where a Treſpaſs doth not, and if the Plaintiff hath miſtaken his Action, that ſhall be no barr to him.</p>
               <p>As to the Caſe put of the <hi>Mayhem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rozal <hi>and</hi> Lampen, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea.</note> that doth not agree with this, becauſe there can be no <hi>Mayhem</hi> without an Aſſault, but there may by a Trover without a Treſpaſs; and though the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of <hi>Mayhem</hi> be of a higher nature than the Aſſault, becauſe it doth ſuppoſe <hi>quod felonice Mayhemiavit,</hi> yet the Plaintiff can only recover damages in both.</p>
               <p>If a Man bring Treſpaſs for the taking of a Horſe, and is barred in that Action, yet if he can get the Horſe in his poſſeſſion, the Defendant in the Treſpaſs can have no Remedy, becauſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch Recovery the Property is ſtill in the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>The Defendant in this Caſe hath juſtified the taking of the Cattle for a Herriot, and by the Demurrer the juſtification is
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:172213:166"/> confeſſed to be true in fact; now by the taking for a Herriot, the property of the Goods was altered; and wherever the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is determined in Treſpaſs, an Action of Trover will never lie for the ſame, but 'tis a good Plea in barr; and ſo it was adjudged here.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That the ſaid <hi>Prior</hi> 25 <hi>H.</hi> 1. granted the ſaid Mannor and Tythes to <hi>William Fitzherbert</hi> and his Heirs, rendring Rent: That the ſaid <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> did Enter and was ſeiſed, and held it diſcharged of Tythes; that his Heirs afterwards granted two Hides of Land, part of the ſaid Mannor, to <hi>S.</hi> with the Tythes, at 5 <hi>s.</hi> Rent; and ſo draws down a Title by Deſcent for 300 years to <hi>F.</hi> who being ſeiſed deviſed the ſame to <hi>Dorothy James,</hi> (under whom the Plaintiff in the Prohibition claimed) and then concludes, That <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did pay the ſaid Rent to the ſaid <hi>Prior,</hi> which ſince the Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was paid to the <hi>King</hi> and his Aſſigns, in diſcharge of all Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Defendant having craved Oyer of the Deed demurred to the Suggeſtion; and Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff in the <hi>Common-Pleas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was now ſaid for the Plaintiff in the Errors, That it doth not appear by the Pleadings whether the Plaintiff in the Prohibition would diſcharge himſelf by a <hi>Praeſcription in non decimando,</hi> or in <hi>modo decimandi;</hi> for the Grant from the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> being the foundation of his Title, he could not thereby be diſcharged, becauſe a Deed before Memory cannot be pleaded, unleſs it hath been allowed in a Court of Eyre, or ſome Court of Record ſince Memory; and this Deed being dated in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>I.</hi> which was 65 years before the time of Memory by the Common Law, that beginning in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>I.</hi> whatever is before that time cannot be tried by Law; if it had been allowed in Eyre, or in ſome of the Courts of Record, it may be pleaded, but no uſage in <hi>pais</hi> can confirm it.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:172213:166"/>
               <p>But ſuppoſing the Deed to be good, the Plaintiff hath alledged a Grant of a portion of Tythes which he cannot have; for at the Common Law a Lay-man was not capable of Tythes in <hi>prender,</hi> for no one had capacity to take or receive them,<note place="margin">Jones 369. 2 Co. 49.</note> ſave only ſpiritual perſons, for which Reaſons a Lay-man could not preſcribe <hi>in non decimando,</hi> but in <hi>modo decimandi</hi> he might, becauſe there is ſtill an annual recompence in ſatisfaction thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis not alledged, that the place where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was parcel of the Demeſus of the Mannor, therefore for what appears it might have been always in Tenancy; and though a Preſcription to a <hi>modus</hi> by the Lord, for himſelf and all his Tenants is good,<note place="margin">Cro.

               <p n="3">3. He hath alledged payment to the <hi>Prior,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>King,</hi> and ſo would infer a <hi>Modus,</hi> to which he hath not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively preſcribed, but by an old Deed upon payment of 5 <hi>s. to all thoſe whoſe Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> And this will not do, for unleſs the <hi>Modus</hi> doth go to the perſon who by Law ought to have Tythes, or unleſs it be for his benefit, 'tis not good; as where it was alledged that he ought to be diſcharged, becauſe time out of memory he employed all the profits of the Land for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of the Body of the Church, and to find neceſſaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this was not a good <hi>Modus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Roll. Abr. 649 placito 8.</note> becauſe 'tis no recompence for the Parſon.</p>
               <p>But it was ſaid by <hi>Saunders</hi> for the Plaintiff in the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, That by the Suggeſtion there was a good Title alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſcharged of Tythes; for 'tis ſet forth that the <hi>Prior</hi> had a portion of Tythes, and the Lands <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Corporation they might preſcribe for Tythes in <hi>prender,</hi> and the Tythes being well in them, they may well grant it to <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> paying 5 <hi>s.</hi> and conſtant payment being alledged ever ſince, 'tis a good Title.</p>
               <p>As to the Deed, tis true, 'tis dated before the time of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; but yet 'tis pleadable becauſe 'tis a private Deed, and ſo need not be allowed in Eyre or in Courts of Record; for ſuch as are not to be pleaded unleſs allowed there, are only Grants of Franchiſes and Liberties from the King, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Deed to be beyond Memory, and the conſtant pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 5 <hi>s.</hi> is a ſufficient title to the Plaintiff if the Deed is not pleadable, and if it is, then 'tis a good diſcharge that way.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:172213:167"/>
               <p>And as to the Objection, that the <hi>Modus</hi> is payable to a wrong perſon; there are many ſuch which are not paid to the Parſon of the Pariſh, but to Lay-men: But in this Caſe it doth appear that there was a <hi>Modus</hi> in the Prior, which being received till it came to the Crown, 'tis good although now paid to others; ſo that for that reaſon the Spiritual Court ought to be prohibited, and of that Opinion was all the Court; for if a <hi>Modus</hi> be paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, who hath the Right of the Tythes, though it be not to the Parſon of the Pariſh, 'tis well enough, eſpecially where the Plaintiff (as here) alledgeth it to be <hi>Portio Decimarum</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prior, ſo that it cannot be ſaid that the Parſon hath not <hi>quid pro quo;</hi> for he had nothing at firſt.</p>
               <p>This Compoſition was made with the Prior, and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is only to ſhew payment to him, and to thoſe who have his Right.</p>
               <p>And as to the date of the Deed, 'tis pleadable though time out of memory, becauſe 'tis a private Deed; but Grants of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes and Liberties muſt be allowed in Eyre; and ſo is my Lord <hi>Rolls</hi> to be underſtood in his Abridgment; Whereupon Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was affirmed.</p>
