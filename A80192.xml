            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN both the Favour and Severity of the Laws were by partial and unu≈øual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods applyed to the Per≈øons, and not to the Ca≈øes of the accu≈øed; when the Life and Honour of an unfortunate Man depended on the Arbitrary Dictates of ≈øome Men in Authority, and when the Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced was more Criminal than the Offence of which the Party was too ea≈øily convicted; then was your Lord≈øhip as far from any Advancement to a judicial Office, as your Judgment and Inclinations were from the Approbation of ≈øuch Proceedings: But no ≈øooner were places of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Profit in the Law made the un≈øought Rewards of good and learned Men, but your Lord≈øhips Merits entituled you to both; who≈øe Moderation and Temper will make your Admini≈øtration ju≈øt and ea≈øie in that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:172213:3"/> Court, to which Fortune had no ≈øhare in your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; and who≈øe natural Abilities are ≈øo improved by a continued and inflexible Study, that your Knowledge is not alone confined to the municipal Laws of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is generally exten≈øive to all humane Learning.</p>
            <p>What Services may not a Prince expect from the Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vigilancy of ≈øuch a Coun≈øellor? And what Benefit may not a divided People find by your equal Di≈øpen≈øation of Ju≈øtice, who (if they can be united in any thing) it mu≈øt be in the general Satisfaction which all have in your Promotion, becau≈øe they know tho≈øe Cau≈øes which come before your Lord≈øhip will receive a due Hearing and Attention without Pa≈ø≈øion or Prejudice to Per≈øons; ≈øuch Emotions being as much beneath the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of your Lord≈øhips Mind, as they are beyond the Duty of Ju≈øtice, and fit only for ≈øuch who will neither be guided by the Rules of Equity or Rea≈øon; ≈øo true is that Saying, <hi>Utitur animi motu, qui uti ratione non pote≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Re≈øpect which is due to the Office of Magi≈øtrates challengeth an univer≈øal Obedience; but that particular Affection and E≈øteem which we have for their Per≈øons is due only to their Vertues and Merits: And ≈øuch is that which I have, and all Men (e≈øpecially tho≈øe of my Profe≈ø≈øion) ought to have for your Lord≈øhip and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Judges in <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter-Hall,</hi> who≈øe Learning and Integrity in judicial Determinations may bring the Laws nearer to Perfection; and who≈øe Examples are the ju≈øt Commendation of the pre≈øent, and I hope will be the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ≈øucceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>I could never under≈øtand the right meaning of that Sentence, <hi>Boni Judicis e≈øt ampliare Juri≈ødictionem</hi> for if that be true, then to what purpo≈øe were tho≈øe Arguments at the Bar of the Hou≈øe of Peers again≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:172213:3"/> ≈øome late Judges for retaining Bills in Equity, the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter whereof was only tryable at the Common Law? Such Complaints are now no more, becau≈øe your Lord≈øhip will not only ≈øupport the Honour and Dignity of that Court, wherein you pre≈øide, in the Beauty of Order, but will not enjoyn any other from exerci≈øing its proper Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</p>
            <p>Thus will the Credit of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and Men will acquie≈øce under the legal Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of each Court; very few Writs of Error will be brought for Error in Law, becau≈øe of the Ju≈øtice and Stability of the Judgment in that Court wherein it was given; and very few Appeals, becau≈øe your Lord≈øhip knows ≈øo well how to temper Equity with Ju≈øtice, that he mu≈øt be a very angry Man, who goes away di≈ø≈øatisfied with your Lord≈øhips Decree.</p>
            <p>But ≈øince the Actions of Men in great Places are ≈øubject to the various Cen≈øures of Mankind, if any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Per≈øon ≈øhould revive tho≈øe Di≈øputes, or quarrel at your Lord≈øhips Admini≈øtration, ≈øuch Complaints would leave no other Impre≈ø≈øion upon the Minds of impartial Men than to convince them of the Wrong done to your Lord≈øhip, and the Folly of ≈øuch Mi≈øapprehen≈øions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have prefixed your Lord≈øhips Name to this mean Performance, taking this occa≈øion to ≈øhew that great Honour and Re≈øpect, which I have for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip; not that I am ≈øo vain to think any thing herein to be worthy of your Lord≈øhips Lei≈øure, neither do I think it Manners to beg your Lord≈øhips Patronage, becau≈øe a good Book will protect it ≈øelf at all times, and a bad one de≈øerves no Protection.</p>
            <p>I know few Books are either prai≈øed or peru≈øed, but what are warranted by the common Repute and E≈øteem
<pb facs="tcp:172213:4"/> of the Writer, which mu≈øt be imputed to the Prejudice and Partiality of Men, and which argues a Diffidence of our natural Parts, as if we did not dare to make a right u≈øe of our own Judgments: For this Rea≈øon I have concealed my Name, that a Judgment may not be made of the Book by the Repute of the Writer. But I hope your Lord≈øhip will not condemn my Ambition, when I ≈øay, I am not altogether unknown to your Lord≈øhip, who am</p>

               <p>And whether the Advow≈øon pa≈ø≈øed by this la≈øt Grant was the Que≈øtion.</p>

               <p>Iu≈øtice <hi>Ellis</hi> in his Argument ≈øaid, That it was plain that when the Mannor came to <hi>H. 8.</hi> the Advow≈øon was appendant, but when it was granted to the Archbi≈øhop, and the Advow≈øon excepted, it then became in gro≈øs, and therefore could never afterward be appendant:<note place="margin">James <hi>and</hi> John≈øon<hi>'s Ca≈øe</hi> Po≈øtea.</note> As an Aere once di≈øunited from the Mannor can never after be part of that Mannor, <hi>Liford's</hi> Ca≈øe, <hi>7 Co.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 'tis as plain, that before the Statute <hi>de Praerogativa Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis cap. 15.</hi> That in the ea≈øe of the King, by the Grant of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, the Advow≈øon though not named pa≈ø≈øed, much more if it be named in any part of the De√©d, as if it be in the <hi>Habendum</hi> though not in the Premi≈ø≈øes; but that mu≈øt be intended of an Advow≈øon appendant.<note place="margin">10 Co. 63.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And though Advow≈øons are excepted by that Statute, yet in ca≈øe of Re≈øtitution an Advow≈øon will pa≈øs by the Words <hi>Adeo plene &amp; integre,</hi> though not named.</p>
               <p>In this Ca≈øe there are general Words and the ≈øame as in<note n="*" place="margin">10 Co. 63. Po≈øtea. Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General <hi>again≈øt</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> 
                  <hi>Whi≈øtler's Ca≈øe;</hi> yet this differs from that, for here 'tis granted <hi>adeo plene,</hi> as the Abbot had it; by tho≈øe Words it doth not pa≈øs, for then it was appendant, but now it is in gro≈øs; and if the King intended to pa≈øs an Advow≈øon as appendant when 'tis in gro≈øs, the Grant is void, <hi>Hob. 303.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Whi≈øtler's Ca≈øe</hi> there are the Words <hi>Adeo plene,</hi> as in this, and the Advow≈øon was appendant ≈øtill, but yet there are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Words here that will pa≈øs it: <hi>Adeo plene <hi>as the Archbi≈øhop had it,</hi>
                  </hi> will not ≈øerve, becau≈øe he never had it; neither will <hi>Adeo plene <hi>as the Abbot had it</hi>
                  </hi> pa≈øs this Advow≈øon, becau≈øe he had it in gro≈øs; but <hi>Adeo plene <hi>as the King had it by any ways or means what≈øoever,</hi>
                  </hi> tho≈øe general Words are ≈øufficient to pa≈øs it.</p>
               <p>The King grants the Mannor and the Advow≈øon of the Church of <hi>Laburn,</hi> which is certain and by particular Name, part of what follows (as <hi>≈øpectan' <hi>to the Archbi≈øhop</hi>
                  </hi>) is fal≈øe, for it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver belonged to him becau≈øe it was excepted in the Grant of the Mannor to him, but the fir≈øt di≈øcription being full and certain the fal≈øity of the other ≈øhall not avoid the Grant, e≈øpecially when the King is not deceived in his Title nor in the Value, and when there is a certainty of the thing granted.</p>
               <p>Some fal≈øe ≈øugge≈øtions may make his Grant void, as if he grant the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> reciting that it came to him by Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when it came by Purcha≈øe, <hi>Hob. 229.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Lane 11.</note>But if the mi≈ø-recital concerns not the Kings Title or Profit, it doth not vitiate the Grant, <hi>10 H. 2. 4.</hi> Sir <hi>John Le≈øtrange's Ca≈øe,</hi> where the King by Office found had the Ward≈øhip of a Mannor, and makes a Grant thereof reciting <hi>Quod quidem Manerium in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172213:7"/> manus no≈øtras ≈øei≈øit<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> &amp;c.</hi> which was not true, yet the Grant was held good, becau≈øe it was only to make that certain which was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain enough before by a particular de≈øcription. So in <hi>Legat's Ca≈øe, 10 Co. 113.</hi> wherein is cited the Ca≈øe of the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> and <hi>Markham,</hi> to whom the Que√©n had granted the Office of Parker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, <hi>&amp;c. quod quidem Officium</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Rutland <hi>habuit,</hi>
                  </hi> when in truth the Earl never had it before, yet the Grant was held good.</p>
               <p>So al≈øo if he grants for and in con≈øideration of Service done, or Mony paid, if fal≈øe, it avoids not the Grant, becau≈øe ≈øuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderations (when pa≈øt) are not material whether they are true or fal≈øe, <hi>Cro. Jac. 34.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King let the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> of the value of <hi>4 l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> if it be more it is ill, but if he let it by a particular Name, and then adds, <hi>Quod quidem Manerium</hi> is of ≈øuch a value 'tis good, becau≈øe the<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cro. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod quidem</hi> is but the addition of another certainty; ≈øo here the Advow≈øon is granted by ≈øpecial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs Name, but the Clau≈øe that follows, <hi>Dudum ≈øpectan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  </hi> to the Archbi≈øhop, implies a mi≈øtake; and had there be√©n no more in the Ca≈øe this fal≈øity would never have avoided the Grant.</p>
               <p>But when the King had enumerated ≈øeveral ways by which he thought he might be intitled, at la≈øt as a proof that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to pa≈øs it, he adds the≈øe Words, <hi>viz. as it is in our hands by any way or means what≈øoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atkins</hi> Iu≈øtice of the ≈øame Opinion: Where the thing is not granted by an expre≈øs Name, there, if a fal≈øity is in the de≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that thing, the Grant is void even in the ca≈øe of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon per≈øon, as if he grant Lands lately let to <hi>D.</hi> in ≈øuch a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh, and the Lands were not let to <hi>D.</hi> were al≈øo in another Pari≈øh, the Grant is void, becau≈øe the Lands are not particularly named, <hi>Ander≈ø. 148. Heywood's Ca≈øe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A fortiori</hi> in the Ca≈øe of the King, as if he grant <hi>omnia illa tenementa ≈øituata in Wells,</hi> when in truth the Lands did not lie there, for this rea≈øon the Grant was void, becau≈øe it was general, and yet re≈øtrained to a particular Town, and the Pronoun <hi>(illa)</hi> goes through the whole ≈øentence.</p>
               <p>But if a thing is granted by an expre≈øs Name, though there is a Fal≈øity in the de≈øcription, yet in the Ca≈øe of a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon 'tis good.</p>
               <p>As when the Subchantor and Vicars Choral of <hi>Lichfield</hi> made a Grant to <hi>Humfrey Peto</hi> of <hi>78</hi> Acres of Glebe, and of their Tythes Predial and Per≈øonal, and al≈øo of the Tythe of the Glebe, <hi>All which</hi> late were in the occupation of <hi>Margaret Peto,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:172213:8"/> which was not true, yet the Grant was adjudged good; for the Words <hi>All which</hi> are not Words of re≈øtriction unle≈øs when the Clau≈øe is general and the Sentence entire, but not when it is di≈øtinct, <hi>Cro. Car. 548.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the Ca≈øe of the King, if there is a fal≈øity by which the King hath a prejudice, and a Fal≈øity upon the ≈øugge≈øtion of the Party, it will make the Grant void, but every Fal≈øity will not avoid his Grant if it be not to his prejudice.</p>
               <p>But let the Fal≈øity in this Ca≈øe be what it will the <hi>Adeo plene <hi>as it is in our hands</hi>
                  </hi> helps it; and though it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that the≈øe Words will not help the Grant, becau≈øe nothing new is granted, that being done before; 'tis true there is nothing new granted, but that which was before was not well granted till this Clau≈øe came which ≈øupplies and amends the Fal≈øity; for now 'tis apparent that the King intended to pa≈øs the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow≈øon as well as the Mannor, and therefore at la≈øt grants it, be his Title what it will.</p>
               <p>In all Ca≈øes where the Kings Grant is void becau≈øe of any mi≈øtake in his Title, 'tis to be intended the King would not make the Grant unle≈øs the Title were ≈øo as 'tis recited, but here 'tis apparent the King re≈øolved to grant it.</p>

               <p>But he an≈øwered, That that was u≈øual and common, and of that Opinion were all the Iu≈øtices, and ≈øo it was held good.</p>
               <p>It was farther objected, That here is a variance between the Avowry and the finding in the Special Verdict; The Avowant ≈øays that the Rent was <hi>12 s.</hi> and <hi>4 d.</hi> and the Iury find that it was but <hi>3 s.</hi> and <hi>1 d.</hi> He al≈øo ≈øaith, that the Herriot was due upon every Alienation without notice, and they find it due with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice.</p>

               <p>But in <hi>Ejectment</hi> or <hi>Replevin</hi> ≈øuch a Declaration had been naught, becau≈øe therein you are to recover the Term, and therefore the Title mu≈øt be truly ≈øet out, and in <hi>Replevin</hi> you are to have a <hi>Retorn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> habend',</hi> but in <hi>Tre≈øpas</hi> 'tis only by way of excu≈øe. <hi>Sed quaere.</hi>

               <p>As to the ≈øecond variance 'tis not material, for 'tis not true as the Avowant hath ≈øaid, for if the matter in i≈ø≈øue be found, the finding over is but ≈øurplu≈øage; both the Verdict and the Avowry agree that the Defendant may take a Di≈øtre≈øs in ca≈øe of Alienation without notice: And ≈øo he prayed Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>

                  <hi>A</hi> Special Verdict was found in an Ejectment, where the Ca≈øe was:</p>

               <p>And the thr√©e Iu≈øtices, <hi>ab≈øente North</hi> Chief Iu≈øtice, were clear of Opinion, that the collateral Waranty was a barr to the Son, and ≈øo Iudgment was given for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ellis</hi> Iu≈øtice held that his Entry is taken away; for in every Warranty two things are implied, a <hi>Voucher</hi> and <hi>Rebutter;</hi> he that comes in by Voucher calleth the per≈øon into Court, who is bound in the Warranty to defend his Right or yield him other Land in recompence, and mu≈øt come in by Privity; but if a Man have the E≈øtate, though he comes in the <hi>Po≈øt</hi> he may <hi>rebut,</hi> that is, he may repel the Action of the Heir by the Warranty of his Ance≈øtor without ≈øhewing how the E≈øtate came to him, <hi>Fitzh.

               <p>It was formerly objected by the Lord Chief Iu≈øtice <hi>Vaughan,</hi> that this Warranty goes only to the Heirs, not to the A≈ø≈øigns, and here the E≈øtate was conveyed by the two <hi>Prinns</hi> before the Warranty attached.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> But when the E≈øtate pa≈ø≈øeth, the Warranty and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant followeth, and the A≈ø≈øign√©e ≈øhall have the benefit thereof though not named, and ≈øo is the Authority of <hi>38 E. 3. 26.</hi> if a Warranty be made to a Man and his Heirs, the A≈ø≈øigne√© though not named ≈øhall Rebutt, but he cannot Vouch.</p>
               <p>So if <hi>A.</hi> enfeoff <hi>B.</hi> with Warranty, and <hi>B.</hi> enfeoff <hi>C.</hi> without D√©ed, <hi>C.</hi> ≈øhall vouch <hi>A.</hi> as A≈ø≈øigne√© of the Land of <hi>B.</hi> for the Warranty cannot be a≈ø≈øigned.</p>
               <p>In this Ca≈øe, though the Warranty did not attach before the E≈øtate in the Land was transferred, yet if it attach afterwards 'tis well enough, and he who hath the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion ≈øhall Rebutt the Demandant without ≈øhewing how he came by the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>If a Warranty be to one and his Heirs without the word <hi>A≈ø≈øigns,</hi> the A≈ø≈øign√©e inde√©d cannot Vouch, but he may<note n="*" place="margin">1 In≈øt. 265. a 384.</note> Rebutt; for Rebutter is ≈øo incident to a Warranty that a Condition not to Rebutt is void in Law: But 'tis otherwi≈øe of a Condition not to Vouch, for in ≈øuch ca≈øe you may Rebutt.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, it hath b√©en an Opinion that he who claimeth above the Warranty, if it be not attached, cannot take benefit of it by way of Voucher or Rebbutter; as if Tenant in Dower maketh a Feoffment to a Villain with Warranty, and the Lord entreth upon him before the de≈øcent of the Warranty, the Villain can never take advantage of this Warranty by way of Rebutter, becau≈øe the Lords Title is paramount the Warranty, and he cometh not under his E≈øtate to whom the Warranty was made.</p>
               <p>If Land be given to two Brothers in Fe√©, with Warranty to the elde≈øt and his Heirs, the elde≈øt dies without I≈ø≈øue, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor ≈øhall not take benefit by this Warranty for the rea≈øon afore≈øaid.</p>
               <p>But in the Ca≈øe at Barr the Warranty being collateral and annexed to the Land, goeth with the E≈øtate, and whil≈øt that continues the Party may Vouch or Rebutt; ≈øo here the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant though he be only Tenant at Will, for the E≈øtate is in the Bargainors, and their Heirs (there being no Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it either by Livery or Enrolment) yet he may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butt.</p>

               <p>Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkins</hi> was of the ≈øame Opinion, that by this collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Warranty the Entry of the Le≈ø≈øor of the Plaintiff was taken away, for 'tis the nature of a collateral Warranty to be a Barr; a<note n="*" place="margin">Jones Rep. 199, 200. 1 In≈øt. 366, 385. 25 H. 6. 63. Bro. Gar. 4.</note> Right is bound by it; it extingui≈øhes a Right, 'tis annexed to the Land and runs with it.</p>
               <p>If then a collateral Warranty be of this nature, 'tis again≈øt all rea≈øon, that he who is thus bound ≈øhould make any Title to the Land; but 'tis very rea≈øonable that he who comes in <hi>qua≈øi</hi> by that E≈øtate ≈øhould defend his Title.</p>

In this Ca≈øe it was held, that if it had b√©en found that <hi>Margaret</hi> had an E≈øtate for Life, and that <hi>Henry</hi> entred in her Life time, that it had be√©n then a Warranty commenced by Di≈ø≈øei≈øin and would not have bound <hi>Thomas</hi> the Rever≈øioner.

               <p>The circum≈øtances of the Ca≈øe were:</p>
               <p>A <hi>Feme ≈øole</hi> had divers Debts owing to her by <hi>Specialty,</hi> ≈øhe marries the Plainiff, and died, (the Bonds being not put in ≈øuit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Coverture) the Plaintiff admini≈øters, and her Brother ≈øues to have a di≈øtribution; and it was in≈øi≈øted for him, that a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øultation</hi> ought to go becau≈øe the<note n="*" place="margin">22 &amp; 23 Car. 2. c. 10.</note> Statute extendeth to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and therefore the Husband, though not named, ≈øhall make di≈øtribution, like the Statute <hi>de Donis</hi> which only mentions ≈øome E≈øtates Tail; but it has been held that there are ≈øeveral other E≈øtates Tail be≈øides tho≈øe particular in≈øtances there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>The Title of this Act is general, and there is no Preamble to reduce it to particulars; the enacting and provi≈øional Clau≈øe ≈øpeaks in thre√© places of all per≈øons dying inte≈øtate, within which general words a Feme Covert, as well as others, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>But on the other ≈øide it was ≈øaid that this Ca≈øe is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanced in that Act which provides only where the Husband dies inte≈øtate.</p>
               <p>As to what was objected, that this Act is a general provi≈øion and extends to all Ca≈øes of the like nature, the Title of it al≈øo being general, <hi>For ≈øetling of Inte≈øtates E≈øtates;</hi> to that it was ≈øaid, that before the making this Act there were many doubts in tho≈øe Ca≈øes again≈øt which a Provi≈øion was thereby made, and therefore it well became the Prudence of that Parliament to take away all Scruples, and to ≈øettle tho≈øe things which were ≈øo apt to be que≈øtioned: But no doubt was ever made before this Statute to whom Admini≈øtration of the Wives E≈øtate ≈øhould be committed; for by the Statute of <hi>31 Ed. 3. cap. 11.</hi> Power was given to the Ordinary to commit Admini≈øtration to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:172213:16"/> the be≈øt Friend of the Inte≈øtate; and therefore it has be√©n agr√©ed that the<note n="*" place="margin">4 Co. 51. Ognel's Ca≈øe. Cro. Car. 106.

               <p>And 'tis agr√©ed on all ≈øides, that no Di≈øtribution is to be made by an Admini≈øtrator; for if any Suit had been commenced in the Spiritual Court to that purpo≈øes, a Prohibition was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently granted. What need was there to ≈øettle this Matter by Act of Parliament, which was ≈øo clear before?</p>
               <p>And 'tis the more unlikely that the E≈øtates of Feme Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts ≈øhould be intended to be di≈øpo≈øed by this Act, when 'tis con≈øidered that all their E≈øtates con≈øi≈øt only in things in Action, which the Husband might relea≈øe during the Coverture (for all the Goods in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion are by Law ve≈øted in the Husband by the intermarriage) and therefore ≈øuch incon≈øiderable things may be well intended not worthy the care and provi≈øion of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides, the Husband and Wife are but one per≈øon in Law, and this Act provides for the ≈øettling Inte≈øtates E≈øtates; now the Wife cannot be ≈øaid to die inte≈øtate, when her Husband (the better part) ≈øurvives.</p>
               <p>Before the making tho≈øe Acts of <hi>31 Ed. 3. cap. 11.</hi> and <hi>21 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> the Ordinary might have granted Admini≈øtration to a Stranger; but now by the fir≈øt of tho≈øe Laws he is re≈øtrained to the next Friend, and by the other to the Widow or next of Kin; ≈øo that the power which he had at the Common Law, and which was too often by him abu≈øed, being now re≈øtrained, Admini≈øtration mu≈øt be granted as pre≈øcribed by this Law, and no equitable con≈øtruction can take it from the Husband; for how can it be intended that the Parliament would take from him that Right which he had by tho≈øe former Laws, and prefer the Relations of his Wife before him?</p>
               <p>But if the Wife ≈øhall be adjudged an Inte≈øtate within this Act then the Husband mu≈øt lo≈øe all her E≈øtate in Action, and he will be then al≈øo within the rules of di≈øtribution; ≈øo that he mu≈øt be at all the labour and pains of Admini≈øtration (which mu≈øt be granted to him) to defend and get in the E≈øtate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit, for he mu≈øt only deduct his Expences out of the Profits, and di≈øtribute the overplus.</p>
               <p>He is intituled to the Admini≈øtration within the Statute of <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> He is al≈øo intituled to it within the Clau≈øe of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>H. 8.</hi> which Enacts, <hi>That 'tis to be granted to the Wife or next of Kin;</hi> and it ≈øeems very unrea≈øonable that he ≈øhould have no profit for his labour.</p>

               <p>La≈øtly, A Feme Covert can never be intended to dye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtate within the meaning of this Act; for that Clau≈øe which directs what Bond the Ordinary ≈øhall take of the Admini≈øtrator is very remarkable to this purpo≈øe, which provides, <hi>That if it appear the decea≈øed made any Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:172213:21"/>
               <p>At the Common Law, one who had a particular Iuri≈ødiction to hold Pleas within a Liberty, could not hold any Plea of a thing which did ari≈øe out of the Liberty, for though it was tran≈øitory in its nature, yet being alledged not within his Iuri≈ødiction, it was ill, <hi>2 In≈øt. 231.</hi>

               <p>And it was argued by Serjeant <hi>Jones,</hi> that they ≈øhould not pa≈øs; for though Lands would pa≈øs ≈øo by a Fine, becau≈øe it was the Agreement of the Parties; yet in a Recovery 'tis otherwi≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe more certainty is required therein.</p>
               <p>But in Fines no ≈øuch Certainty is required, and therefore a Fine <hi>de Tenementis in Golden-Lane</hi> hath be√©n held good though neither Vill, Pari≈øh or Hamlet is mentioned.</p>

               <p>And the rea≈øon of this difference is, becau≈øe in Fines there are Covenants, which, though they are real in re≈øpect of the Land, yet 'tis but a per≈øonal Action, in which the Land is not demanded <hi>ex directo;</hi> but in a Recovery greater preci≈øene≈øs is required, that being a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> where the Land it ≈øelf is demanded, and the Defendant mu≈øt make An≈øwer to it, <hi>Cro.

               <p>Liberties in Iudgment of Law are incorporeal, and therefore 'tis ab≈øurd to ≈øay that Lands which are corporeal ≈øhall be therein contained.</p>

               <p>There is no <hi>Praecipe</hi> in the Regi≈øter to recover Lands within a Liberty, neither is there any authority in all the Law Books for ≈øuch a Recovery; and therefore if ≈øuch a thing ≈øhould be allowed many inconveniences would follow; for a good Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe</hi> would be wanting, and the intent of the Parties could not ≈øupply that.</p>

               <p>To this Plea the Plaintiff demurred, and the Defendant joyned in Demurrer which was argued by <hi>Turner</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff, and by Serjeant <hi>Seys</hi> for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>This was a bad Plea, for 'tis a Rule in all Law Books, that every Plea ought to an≈øwer the matter which is charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Defendant,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> in the Declaration, which is not done here,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:172213:43"/> becau≈øe the Defendant doth neither aver that he did accompt, or confe≈øs or avoid, or traver≈øe it, which he ought to do, after the Plaintiff had alledged a reque≈øt to accompt, and a refu≈øal.</p>
               <p>'Tis an ab≈øolute Covenant which charges him to be accompta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and not if the Plaintiff would allow Par≈øons Dinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for 'tis impo≈ø≈øible that the Plainntiff can make any ≈øuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, till the Defendant hath accompted; for how can there be a di≈øcounting without an Accompt?</p>
               <p>If the Plaintiff had told him before the Accompt, that he would not allow any thing upon the Accompt, this would not have been prejudicial to bart him of his Action, ≈øo as it had been before the reque≈øt: For if a Man makes a Feoffment in Fee, upon condition that if the Feoffor pay <hi>100 l.</hi> at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> the Feoffment ≈øhall be void; and before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> the Feoffee tells him that he will not receive the Money at that time; this ≈øhall not prejudice him, becau≈øe tis no refu≈øal in Law.</p>
               <p>The Defendant in this Ca≈øe is to do the fir≈øt act, <hi>viz.</hi> to Accompt; and when that is neglected by him, it ≈øhall never prejudice him who is to do a ≈øub≈øequent act, <hi>5 Co. 19, 20. Higginbottoms Ca≈øe, 22 &amp; 23 Hallin and Lambs Ca≈øe.</hi>

               <p>The breach a≈ø≈øigned was, that the Defendant had not made Livery and Sei≈øin, and upon performance pleaded, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff did demux, and upon great debate it was re≈øolved that the Covenant was not broken, becau≈øe the Plaintiff had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that which was fir≈øt to be done on his part, <hi>viz.</hi> to name the Lives.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, that the≈øe Covenants have a relation one to the other; and ≈øo non-performance of the one, may be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in bar to the other.</p>
               <p>But to that he an≈øwered, they are di≈øtinct and mutual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and there may be ≈øeveral Actions brought again≈øt each other. The Ca≈øe of<note n="*" place="margin">Stiles 186. 187.</note>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172213:44"/> no excu≈øe for the Defendant, and it was adjudged, that this was not a condition precedent, but di≈øtinct and mutual Covenants, upon which ≈øeveral Actions might be brought.</p>
               <p>This cannot be a Condition precedent, for the Defendant pleads, <hi>&amp; ulterius agreat<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> &amp; provi≈øum e≈øt</hi> that the Plaintiff ≈øhall di≈øcompt and reimbur≈øe the Defendant; and here the word <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øum e≈øt</hi> doth not make a Condition but a Covenant, <hi>27 H. 8. 14, 15.

               <p>There is another fault in the Plea, for the Defendant averrs, that the Plaintiff hath not reimbur≈øed him ≈øeveral Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which is altogether incertain, for it doth not appear what is due, <hi>28 H. 8. Dyer 28. 9 Ed. 4. 16. 12 H. 8. 6. a.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Noy 128.</note> in which <hi>Howel</hi> covenants with <hi>Morgan</hi> to make a Conveyance to him of Land by Fine, provided that if he pay <hi>Morgan 100 l.</hi> at the end of thirt√©en years, that then the u≈øe of the Fine ≈øhall be to the Congni≈øor, and covenants that <hi>Morgan</hi> ≈øhall enjoy the ≈øaid Lands for thirt√©en years, and for ever after if the <hi>100 l.</hi> be not paid.</p>
               <p>The A≈ø≈øurance was not made, and this was adjuged no Lea≈øe for thirt√©en years, becau≈øe it was the intent of the Parties to make an A≈ø≈øurance only in the nature of a Mortgage, which is but a Covenant.</p>
               <p>And this appears likewi≈øe to be the intention of the Parties here, becau≈øe in the very Deed 'tis recited that the Lands are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pihold.</p>
               <p>It al≈øo ≈øounds directly in Covenant, for 'tis that <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øhall or may enjoy without the lawful let or interruption of the Le≈ø≈øor.</p>
               <p>All Agreements mu≈øt be con≈øtrued <hi>≈øecundum ≈øubjectam materiam</hi> if the Matter will bear it, and in mo≈øt Ca≈øes are governed by the intention of the Parties and not to work a Wrong; and therefore if Tenant in Tail makes a Lea≈øe for Life, it ≈øhall be taken for his own Life; and yet if before the Statute of Entails he made ≈øuch
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:172213:46"/> Lea≈øe, he being then Tenant in F√©e-≈øimple, it had been an E≈øtate during the Life of the Le≈ø≈ø√©e; but when the Statute had made it unlawful for him to bind his Heir, then the Law con≈øtrues it to be for his own Life, becau≈øe otherwi≈øe it would work a Wrong,<note place="margin">Hob. 276.</note> 
                  <hi>Co. Lit. 42.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in this ca≈øe it ≈øhall not amount to a Lea≈øe for the manife≈øt inconveniency which would follow, but it ≈øhall be con≈øtrued as a Covenant, and then no injury is done.</p>
               <p>On the Defendants part it was argued by Serjeant <hi>Newdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> that though this was in the Ca≈øe of a Copyhold,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> that did not make any difference; for the plain meaning of the Parties was to make a Lea≈øe: But where the Words are doubtful and ≈øuch as may admit of diver≈øe con≈øtructions, whether they will amount to a Lea≈øe or not, there they ≈øhall be taken as a Covenant to prevent a Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>So al≈øo if they are only In≈øtructions, as if a Man by Articles ≈øealed and delivered is contented to demi≈øe ≈øuch Lands, and a Rent is re≈øerved, and Covenants to repair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or if one covenants with another to permit and ≈øuffer him to have and enjoy ≈øuch Lands,<note place="margin">1 Rol.

               <p>But for an Authority in the Point the Lady<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cro. 301.</note> 
                  <hi>Mountagues</hi> Ca≈øe was cited, where it was adjudged, that if a Copyholder make a Lea≈øe for a year warranted by the Cu≈øtom, <hi>&amp; ≈øic de anno in annum</hi> during ten years, 'tis a good Lea≈øe for ten years and a Forfeiture of the Copyhold E≈øtate, <hi>Vide Hill. 15 &amp; 16 Car. 2.

               <p>The Court inclined that it was a good Lea≈øe,<note place="margin">Curia.</note> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence a Forfeiture of the Copihold, and that a Licence in this Ca≈øe could not be ≈øuppo≈øed to prevent the Forfeiture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe if that had been, the Iury would have found it; the meaning of the Parties mu≈øt make a Con≈øtruction here and that ≈øeems very ≈øtrong that 'tis a good Lea≈øe; but they gave no Iudgment.</p>

               <p>THE Plaintiff brought an Action on the Ca≈øe again≈øt the Sheriff for a fal≈øe Return,<note place="margin">Ca≈øe lies not again≈øt the Sheriff for return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Cepi Corpus &amp; paratum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo,</hi> though the Party doth not appear.

               <p>The Plaintiff demurrs; and whether this Action lies again≈øt the Defendant was the Que≈øtion, who refu≈øed to proceed again≈øt him by way of Amerciament, or to take an A≈ø≈øignment of the Bail-Bond.</p>
               <p>This Ca≈øe depended in Court ≈øeveral Terms.

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> What the Common Law was before the making of this Statute.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> What alteration thereof the Statute had made.</p>
               <p>At the Common Law Men were to appear per≈øonally to an≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer the Writ, the Form of which required it, and no Attorney could be made in any Action till <hi>Edw. 1. de gratia ≈øpeciali</hi> gave leave to his Subjects to appoint them and commanded his Iudges to admit them, <hi>2 In≈øt. 377.</hi> After the Arre≈øt the Sheriff mighttie the Party to what Conditions he plea≈øed, and he might keep him till he had complied with ≈øuch Conditions, which often ended in taking extravagant Bonds, and ≈øometimes in other Oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, for remedy whereof this Statute was made, in which the Clau≈øe that concerns this Ca≈øe is, <hi>viz. If the Sheriff return upon any per≈øon <hi>Cepi Corpus</hi> or <hi>Reddidit ≈øe,</hi> that he ≈øhall be chargeable to have the Body at the day of the Return of the Writ in ≈øuch form as before the making the Act;</hi> ≈øo that as to the Return of the Writ this Statute hath made no alteration, the Sheriff being bound to have the Party at a day as before.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:172213:48"/>
               <p>All the alteration made of the Common Law by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is that the Sheriff now is bound to let the Party out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon upon rea≈øonable Sureties of ≈øufficient per≈øons, which before he was not obliged to do; and it would be a Ca≈øe of great hard≈øhip upon all the Sheriffs of <hi>England,</hi> if they (being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to let out the Party to Bail) ≈øhould al≈øo be ≈øubject to an Action for ≈øo doing, becau≈øe they have him not at the day; ≈øo that the intent of the Law mu≈øt be (when it charges the Sheriff to have the Body at the Return) that he ≈øhould be liable to a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty if the Party did not then appear, not to be recovered by Action but by Amerciament.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cro.

               <p>When the Security is thus taken, if the Defendant doth not appear at the Return of the Writ, the Plaintiff by Amerciaments ≈øhall compel him to bring in the Body, or to a≈ø≈øign the Bond, either of which is a full ≈øatisfaction and as much as is required.</p>

               <p>This Action is grounded upon a fal≈øe Return, when in truth there is no Return made, or if any, 'tis a very imperfect Return till the Body be in Court; and this is the rea≈øon why the Court will not allow it, but amerce the Sheriff till he make the Party appear; 'tis not like a compleat Return, as a <hi>Non e≈øt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or the Return of <hi>Nulla Bona</hi> upon a <hi>Fi.

               <p>Neither will it follow that becau≈øe the Sheriff may be amerced therefore no Action will lie again≈øt him; for in many Ca≈øes he may be amerced, and yet an Action on the Ca≈øe will lie again≈øt him at the Suit of the Party, <hi>41 A≈ø≈ø. pl. 12. fol. 254. Latch 187.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this Action will not lie is again≈øt the very end of the Statute, and the rea≈øonable con≈øtruction thereof in the la≈øt Clau≈øe, which Enacts, <hi>That if the Sheriff return a <hi>Cepi Corpus,</hi> he ≈øhall be charged to have the Body at the Return as before the making of the Statute;</hi> now before this Law he was lyable to an Action, if after ≈øuch a Return made the Party did not appear, and therefore this Action being grounded upon the Common Law, is ≈øtill pre≈øerved ≈øince no alteration hereof hath be√©n made by this Statute.</p>
               <p>'Tis true an Action of E≈øcape is taken away, but not an Action on the Ca≈øe for a fal≈øe Return, and upon this difference are all the Authorities cited on the other ≈øide, as <hi>Cro.

                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iu≈øtice, <hi>Wyndham</hi> and <hi>Atkins</hi> Iu≈øtices,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> held that the Action would not lie; for when the Sheriff returns <hi>Cepi Corpus &amp; paratum habeo,</hi> though he have him not in Court 'tis
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:172213:49"/> no fal≈øe Return; for if he hath taken Bail, he hath done what by Law he ought to do; if he Arre≈øt a Man in <hi>York≈øhire,</hi> the Law will not compel him to bring the Party hither to the Bar, becau≈øe of the charge; if he make an in≈øufficient Return, neither the Party or the Court are deluded, becau≈øe the common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in ≈øuch ca≈øes mu≈øt be pur≈øued, by which the Party will have remedy. This Return is true; and Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkyns</hi> held, that the Sheriff was not obliged by the Statute to return only a <hi>Cepi Corpus &amp; paratum habeo,</hi> but might return, that he took Bail; for the Statute provides, that if he return a <hi>Cepi Corpus,</hi> he ≈øhall be chargable as before, but doth not enjoyn him to make ≈øuch return; the Ca≈øe of <hi>Bowles</hi> and <hi>La≈ø≈øels</hi> is full in this point, and therefore Iudgment was given for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>But Iu≈øtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> was of another Opinion; ≈øays he, this Action being brought becau≈øe the Defendant ≈øaid he had the Body ready, when in truth he had not, was an apparent injury to the Plaintiff, of whom the Statute mu≈øt have ≈øome con≈øideration; for it doth not require the Sheriff to ≈øay <hi>Cepi corpus &amp; paratum habeo,</hi> but he mu≈øt make his Return good, or otherwi≈øe tho≈øe words are very in≈øignificant; and if the Statute obliges him to let the party to Bail, and nothing more is thereby intended for the benefit of the Plaintiff, why doth the Court amerce the Sheriff, and puni≈øh him for doing what the Statute directs? Therefore if the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff brings a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> upon the <hi>Cepi,</hi> and the Defendant doth not appear the Plaintiff, is then well entituled to this Action.</p>

Anno 1664.</hi> an Act of Parliament was made for ≈øetling old Sir <hi>Robert Carr's</hi> E≈øtate, whereby the Tru≈øte√©s therein named, are appointed to ≈øell it for payment of Debts, and rai≈øing this Portion; by which Act all Conveyances made by old Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> ≈øince the year <hi>1639.</hi> are made void, except ≈øuch as were made upon valuable con≈øiderations; but all tho≈øe made by him before the ≈øaid year, with power of revocation (if not actually revoked) are ≈øaved; and in the year <hi>1636.</hi> he had executed a Conveyance, by which he had made a Settlement of his E≈øtate in Tayl, with a power of revocation; but it did not appear that he did ever revoke the ≈øame.</p>
               <p>The greate≈øt part of the Lands appointed by this Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to be ≈øold by the Tru≈øtees, are the Lands compri≈øed in that Settlement; and now, after the death of Sir <hi>Robert Carr,</hi> the Plaintiff exhibits his Bill again≈øt the Son, (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ≈øuch a Settlement was made in the year <hi>1636.</hi> till the Defendant had ≈øet it forth in his An≈øwer:) and by this Bill he de≈øires that the Tru≈øtees may execute their Tru≈øt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he may have relief.</p>
               <p>On the Defendants ≈øide it was urged,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> that after the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age there was a Bond given for an additional Ioynture, and it was upon that account that the Defendant was drawn in to execute the≈øe Articles: And if the very rea≈øon and foundation of his entring into them failed, then they ≈øhall not bind him in Equity; and in this Ca≈øe it did fail, becau≈øe the Plaintiff had di≈øabled him≈øelf to make any other Ioynture, by a Pre-convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made and executed by him, of his whole E≈øtate; and if this agreement will not bind him, then this Court cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Plaintiffs remedy, or appoint more than what by the Articles is agreed to be done; neither can the Defendants ≈øeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incumber the E≈øtate Tayl in Equity, becau≈øe the Lands were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:172213:50"/> not then in him, his Father being Tenant in Tayl, and then living; and the ≈øub≈øequent de≈øcent by which the Lands are ca≈øt upon him, alters not the Ca≈øe; for the very right which de≈øcends is ≈øaved by the Act from being charged.</p>
               <p>But on the other ≈øide it was argued, that though the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age did proceed upon the Defendants ≈øealing, yet the A≈ø≈øurance which was to be made, was a principal Motive thereunto; and it being agreed before Marriage, though not executed, it was very ju≈øt that he ≈øhould Seal afterwards; and though the additional Ioynture was not made, yet there was no colour that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ≈øhould break his Articles, for that rea≈øon; becau≈øe if the Bond be not performed, 'tis forfeited and may be ≈øued; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared in the ca≈øe, of any Conveyance made by Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> whereby he had di≈øabled him≈øelf to make an additional Ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he hath expre≈øly denied it upon his Oath. And though it was was objected, that the Money was rai≈øed by the old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Carr,</hi> and by the direction of the Tru≈øtees lodged in the hands of one <hi>Cook,</hi> who is become in≈øolvent; It was an≈øwered that there was no proof of the con≈øent of the Tru≈øtees, and therefore this payment cannot alter the ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>After the matter thus ≈øtated, the Lord Chancellor delivered his Opinion, That the <hi>6000 l.</hi> is doe to the Plaintiff, unpaid and un≈øatisfied; for though the Marriage had not taken effect, yet the Covenant binds the Defendant, becau≈øe a Deed is good for a Duty, without any con≈øideration.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Plaintiff has remedy again≈øt the per≈øon of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant at Law, for this <hi>6000 l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> He has remedy again≈øt ≈øuch of the Defendants Lands, which are not compri≈øed in the Settlement made <hi>1636.</hi> for as to them the Tru≈øtees may be enjoyned to execute the Tru≈øt.</p>
               <p>And he de≈øired the Opinions of the two Iu≈øtices, if any thing more could be done in this ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>Iu≈øtice <hi>Windham</hi> was of Opinion, that nothing more could be done, but to make a Decree to enforce the execution of the Tru≈øt.</p>
               <p>And Iu≈øtice <hi>Wild</hi> ≈øaid, that the Plaintiff has his remedy at Law again≈øt the Defendant, and upon the Act of Parliament again≈øt the Tru≈øtees; but upon the≈øe Articles no Decree could be made to bind the Lands, for that would be to give a much better ≈øecurity than the Parties had agreed on. But if there had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:172213:50"/> been a Covenant in the Articles, that a Fine ≈øhould be levied, it might have been otherwi≈øe; 'tis only that a Fine is intended to be levied.</p>
               <p>But as to that the Lord Chancellor was of Opinion, that it was a good Covenant to levy a Fine, for the words <hi>(Articles of Agreement, &amp;c.)</hi> go quite through, and make that Clau≈øe a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but becau≈øe Iu≈øtice <hi>Wild</hi> was of another Opinion, he de≈øired the Attorny General to argue the≈øe three Points.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Whether this was a Covenant to levy a Fine or not.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> If it was a Covenant, whether this Court can decree him to do it, for though the Party has a good remedy at Law; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Court might not give remedy upon the Land.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> If it was a Covenant to levie a Fine, and the Court may decree the Defendant to do it, yet whether ≈øuch a Decree can be made upon the prayer of this Bill, it not being particularly prayed; for the Plaintiff concluded his Bill, with praying relief in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Tru≈øt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term following the≈øe Points were argued by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Maynard,</hi> Sir <hi>John Churchil,</hi> and Sir <hi>John King</hi> for the Plaintiff; Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> and Mr. <hi>Solicitor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Keck</hi> for the Defendant, all in one day, and in the ≈øame order as named.</p>
               <p>The Councel for the Defendant urged,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> that this was no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in Law to enforce the Defendant to levy a Fine: 'Tis agre√©d that there is no need of the word <hi>(Covenant)</hi> to make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but any thing under the Hand and Seal of the Parties, which imports an Agreement, will amount to a Covenant; ≈øo in <hi>1 Roll. Abr. 518.</hi> the≈øe words in a Lea≈øe for years, <hi>viz. That the Le≈ø≈øee ≈øhall repair,</hi> make a Covenant; ≈øo in the Ca≈øe of Indentures of Apprenti≈øhip there are not the formal words of a Covenant, but only an Agreement that the Ma≈øter ≈øhall do this, and the Apprentice ≈øhall do that, and the≈øe are Covenants; but in all the≈øe Ca≈øes there is ≈øomething of an undertaking; as in <hi>1 Roll 519. Walker <hi>ver≈øus</hi> Walker,</hi> If a Deed be made to another in the≈øe words, <hi>viz. I have a Writing in my cu≈øtody, in which W. ≈øtandeth bound to B. in 100 l. and I will be ready to produce it;</hi> This is a Covenant, for there is a pre≈øent engaging to do it, but there are no ≈øuch words here, 'tis only a recital, <hi>That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Fine is intended to be levied to ≈øuch U≈øes, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis only Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive to another Clau≈øe, without po≈øitive or affirmative words, and therefore can never be intended to make a Covenant, but are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:172213:51"/> recited to another purpo≈øe, <hi>viz. To declare the U≈øe of a Fine, in ca≈øe ≈øuch ≈øhould be levied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Articles of Agreement are executed in con≈øideration of an intended Marriage, and one ≈øide Covenants to do one thing, and the other ≈øide another thing; was it ever imagined that upon the≈øe words, <hi>(Whereas a Marriage is intended, &amp;c.)</hi> that an Action of Covenant might be brought to enforce the Marriage: And yet there is as much rea≈øon for the one as the other; therefore ≈øince the Parties have neither made nor intended it for a Covenant, 'tis not nece≈ø≈øary that it ≈øhould be ≈øo con≈øtrued.</p>
               <p>If this is a Covenant, the Parties at Common Law could only bring an Action of Covenant, and recover damages for not levying of the Fine, and that the Plaintiff may do now upon the expre≈øs Covenant for non-payment of the Money; but then the breach mu≈øt be a≈ø≈øigned according to the words, <hi>viz. That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant did not levy a Fine as intended;</hi> who may plead that a Fine was never intended to be levied, and by what Iury ≈øhall this be tryed?</p>
               <p>It may be objected, that every Article ≈øtands upon its own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and the Title of them (being <hi>Articles of Agreement,</hi>) extends to every Paragraph.</p>
               <p>But as to that, each of the≈øe Articles is to be con≈øidered by it ≈øelf; and every Paragraph begins, <hi>viz it is Covenanted, &amp;c.</hi> which ≈øhews it was never intended to make it a Covenant, by the Title of the Articles, and the rather, becau≈øe 'tis unrea≈øonable to make ≈øuch a con≈øtruction; for it is not to be ≈øuppo≈øed that a Man will covenant that a Fine ≈øhall be levied, as in this Ca≈øe, by <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and him≈øelf, when 'tis not in his power to compel another.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Admitting it to be a Covenant, yet it would be very hard to decree the execution of a Fine <hi>in Specie;</hi> for the Father of the Defendant was alive when he executed the Deed, and the Father being Tenant in Tayl, who never ≈øealed, the Son could have no pre≈øent Right, who did Seal; and if matters had ≈øtood now as then, how could a Court of Equity Decree a Fine, by which a Right might be extingui≈øhed, but could never be tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and by which no u≈øe could be declared? For though ≈øuch a Fine be good by <hi>E≈øtoppel,</hi> before the Tayl de≈øcends to the I≈ø≈øue; yet no u≈øe can be declared thereupon, nor upon any Fine by <hi>E≈øtoppel;</hi> and there is no rea≈øon why length of time ≈øhould put the Plaintiff into a better condition than he was when the Articles were executed.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:172213:51"/>
                  <hi>3.</hi> And la≈øtly, ≈øince here is a particular relief prayed in no wi≈øe concerning the levying of this Fine, but only a Relief in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Tru≈øt, this Court cannot Decree the Defendant to levy one, it being again≈øt the con≈øtant cour≈øe and rules thereof.</p>
               <p>But on the other ≈øide it was ≈øaid by the Plaintiffs Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that the words do declare the intent of the Parties,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> that a Fine ≈øhall be levied; and 'tis the Intent which makes the Agreement; and where there is an Agreement an Action of Covenant will lye.</p>
               <p>If a Man Covenant to do ≈øuch a thing in con≈øideration of a Marriage, and then there is this Clau≈øe, <hi>viz. Whereas it is intended that he ≈øhall Marry before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> that then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> certainly upon the whole Deed here is a good Covenant to marry before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Ca≈øe 'tis Covenanted, that <hi>6000 l.</hi> ≈øhall be paid, and that it ≈øhall be ≈øecured as herein is after mentioned; then 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that a Fine is intended to be levied for that purpo≈øe, this is a good Covenant to make a Security by a Fine.</p>
               <p>But if the particular manner how the the Security was to be made had been omitted, yet upon the words <hi>(Covenant to ≈øecure it,)</hi> the Court hath a good ground to make a Decree to levy a Fine, that being the only way to ≈øecure it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> As to the Objection, that the Defendant had but a po≈ø≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of having the E≈øtate when he entred into this Couenant, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to be ≈øo) yet why ≈øhould that be a rea≈øon to hinder him from making good the Security when he hath it; if Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son Covenant to make an A≈ø≈øurance, the Father who had the E≈øtate in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion dies, the Decree mu≈øt then operate upon that E≈øtate in the hands of the Son.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Here is a general prayer for a proper relief, in which the Plaintiffs Ca≈øe is included, and therefore prayed Iudgment for him.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor,<note place="margin">Curia.</note> pre≈øently after the Arguments on each ≈øide, delivered his Opinion, That upon the whole frame of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles there was a Covenant to levy a Fine; for wherever there is an Agreement under Hand and Seal, Covenant lies; that in this Ca≈øe there was a plain Covenant, if the fir≈øt Article of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving farther ≈øecurity, be coupled to that Paragraph of intending to levy a Fine, for that is the farther ≈øecurity intended, ≈øo that the meaning of the Parties runs thus; I do intend to levy a Fine, which is for the Securing of <hi>6000 l.</hi> and this appears to be their Agreement. Now there are many Ca≈øes where words
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:172213:52"/> will make a Covenant, becau≈øe of the Agreement, when the general words of <hi>Covenant, Grant, &amp;c.</hi> are wanting; as<note n="*" place="margin">Hays <hi>ver≈øus</hi> Bicker≈øtaff. Antea &amp; Po≈øtea. Cook <hi>ver≈øus</hi> Herl.</note> 
                  <hi>Yielding</hi> and <hi>Paying</hi> will make a Covenant, for the rea≈øons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Party having provided him≈øelf of real as well as per≈øonal Security, by the≈øe Articles, he ≈øaid he would not deprive him of it; e≈øpecially when it might be more trouble to bring an Action of Covenant for the not levying of the Fine, for upon that many Que≈øtions might ari≈øe, as who ≈øhould do the fir≈øt act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which rea≈øons he decreed the execution of the Fine <hi>in Specie.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Henly</hi> Prothonotary of the Court of <hi>Kings Bench</hi> makes a Grant of the Office of Clark of the Papers (which of right did belong to him) unto Mr. <hi>Vidian</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> for their lives and the life of the longe≈øt liver of them.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Mr. <hi>Vidian</hi> makes a parol Surrender of this Grant, and then Sir <hi>Robert Henley</hi> makes a new Grant to Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and Mr. <hi>A≈øton</hi> the Defendant for their Lives, and for the life of the Survivor: Mr. <hi>Vidian</hi> dies, and whether the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff <hi>Woodward</hi> ≈øhould have all the profits of the Office by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor≈øhip was the Que≈øtion.</p>
               <p>It was agreed that this was one entire Office; and as one of them cannot make a Deputy ≈øo he cannot appoint a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øor.</p>
               <p>But the doubt was whether the Plaintiff had not con≈øented that the Defendant ≈øhould be taken into the Office, and had agreed to the new Grant which was made afterwards; for it was
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:172213:54"/> admitted that if he con≈øented before Mr. <hi>A≈øton</hi> came in, it mu≈øt then be found for the Defendant; for by his con≈øent he had barred him≈øelf of his Right and Benefit of Survivor≈øhip, and that by his con≈øenting to the new Grant that in Law was a Surrender of the fir≈øt Grant, and then the Defendant is jointe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Plaintiff, and if ≈øo, his Action is not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>And upon the≈øe two Points only it was left to the Iury, who found for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The Evidence to the fir≈øt Point was, that when Mr. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> propo≈øed to the Court that the Defendant might ≈øucceed him, after ≈øome oppo≈øition and unwillingne≈øs in the Plaintiff to agre√© to it; yet at length he declared that he did ≈øubmit to it, and accordingly the Defendant was admitted; but there was no formal Entry of his Admittance as an Officer, but only the Courts declaring their Con≈øent that he ≈øhould take his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>On the other ≈øide it was in≈øi≈øted on for the Plaintiff and proved that his Submi≈ø≈øion to the Court was with a <hi>≈øalvo jure,</hi> and what he did was <hi>reluctante animo,</hi> thinking it was a hard≈øhip upon him, as he often ≈øince declared; ≈øo that it was <hi>qua≈øi</hi> a compul≈øory Con≈øent made in obedience to the Court with whom it was not good manners in him to contend.</p>
               <p>Several Points were ≈øtirred at the Trial, as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether a Surrender of the Grant of an Office by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol was good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether if a Grant be made of an Office or of any other thing which lies in Grant, and the Deed is lo≈øt or cancelled, the Office or the thing granted falls to the ground, for the Deed is the foundation; and a Ca≈øe was cited in the Lord <hi>Dyer;</hi> If there be two Iointenants and one cancels the Deed it hath de≈øtroyed the Right of the other, <hi>Quaere</hi> of the≈øe things: But it was agreed, that if two Men who have one Office for their Lives and the ≈øurvivor of them, if one ≈øurrenders to the other, and then a new Grant is made to this other and a Stranger, he hath debarred him≈øelf of the Survivor≈øhip, and he and the Stranger are jointly ≈øei≈øed.</p>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> It may well ≈øtand with the Nature and the Words of the Fine.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> It will be mo≈øt agreeable both to the Iudgments and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which have formerly b√©en given in the like Ca≈øes.</p>
               <p>And as to the fir≈øt of the≈øe it will be nece≈ø≈øary to con≈øider what will be the effect and con≈øequence of levying this Fine both on the one ≈øide and the other. It cannot be denyed but that there was a Purcha≈øe intended to be made under this Fine, and that the Parties were willing to pa≈øs away their E≈øtate with the lea≈øt hazard that might be to them≈øelves; neither can it be imagined that they intended to defeat this Purcha≈øe as ≈øoon as it was made, which they mu≈øt do if this Fine works a Forfeiture; for then he in Remainder in Tail is entituled to a pre≈øent Entry, and ≈øo the E≈øtates for Life which the Baron and Feme had are lo≈øt, and there was a po≈ø≈øibility al≈øo of lo≈øing the Rever≈øion in Fe√©, which the Tenant in Tail after his Entry might have barred by a Common Recovery.</p>
               <p>And had not the Parties intended only to pa≈øs both the E≈øtates, which they lawfully might pa≈øs, why did they levy this Fine <hi>≈øur conce≈ø≈øit?</hi> They might have levyed a Fine <hi>≈øur Cogni≈øance de droit come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> and that had be√©n a Di≈ø≈øei≈øin.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides what need was there for them to mention any E≈øtate which they had in the≈øe Hou≈øes, if they had intended a Di≈ø≈øei≈øin? But this being done, ≈øuch a Con≈øtruction is to be made as may ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the intent of the Parties; and it would be very unrea≈øonable, that what was intended to pre≈øerve the E≈øtate ≈øhould now be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to work a Di≈ø≈øe≈øin ≈øo as to forfeit it; and ≈øuch a Di≈ø≈øei≈øin upon which this collateral Warranty ≈øhall operate and barr the E≈øtate in Remainder.</p>
               <p>And therefore no more ≈øhall pa≈øs by this Fine than what lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may; and rather than it ≈øhall be con≈øtrued to work a Wrong, the E≈øtate ≈øhall pa≈øs by fractions; for both the E≈øtates of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Mitton</hi> for Life, are not ≈øo nece≈ø≈øarily joyned and united by this Fine that no room can be left for ≈øuch a Con≈øtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Such a Con≈øtruction will not agre√© with the Nature and Words of this Fine. 'Tis true, a Fine as it is of the mo≈øt ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and of the greate≈øt Authority, ≈øo 'tis of the greate≈øt force and efficacy to convey an E≈øtate, and the mo≈øt effectual Feoffment of Record where 'tis a Feoffment, and likewi≈øe the mo≈øt effectual Relea≈øe, where 'tis to be a Relea≈øe.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:172213:62"/>
               <p>But on a bare Agre√©ment made in Actions betw√©en the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant and Tenant at the Barr, and drawn up there, the Iudges will alter and amend ≈øuch Fines, if they did not in all things an≈øwer the intention of the Parties.<note place="margin">24 Ed. 3. 36.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Po≈øtea.</note>'Tis agreed that Fines can work a Di≈ø≈øei≈øin when they can have no other Interpretation, as if Tenant <hi>pur auter vie</hi> levy a Fine to a Stranger for his own Life, 'tis more than ≈øuch a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant could do, becau≈øe his E≈øtate was during the Life of another and no longer.</p>
               <p>So a Fine <hi>≈øur Cogni≈øance de droit, &amp;c.</hi> implies a F√©e, which being levyed by any one who has but a particular E≈øtate will make a Di≈ø≈øei≈øin.</p>
               <p>But this Fine <hi>≈øur conce≈ø≈øit</hi> has be√©n always taken to be the mo≈øt harmle≈øs of all others, and can be compared to nothing el≈øe than a Grant of <hi>totum ≈øtatum ≈øuum &amp; quicquid habet, &amp;c.</hi> by which no more is granted than what the Cogni≈øor had at the time of the Grant, and ≈øo it hath been always con≈øtrued.</p>
               <p>Ind√©ed there is a Fine <hi>≈øur conce≈ø≈øit</hi> which expre≈ø≈øes no E≈øtate of the Grantor, and this is properly levyed by Tenant in F√©e or Tail; but when particular Tenants pa≈øs over their ≈øeveral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates they generally grant <hi>totum &amp; quicquid habent in tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis praedictis,</hi> being very cautious to expre≈øs what E≈øtate they had therein.</p>
               <p>When this Fine <hi>≈øur conce≈ø≈øit</hi> was fir≈øt invented the Iudges in tho≈øe days looked upon the Words <hi>quicquid habent, &amp;c.</hi> to be in≈øignificant, and for that rea≈øon in <hi>Anno 17 E. 3. 66.</hi> they were refu≈øed: The ca≈øe was; Two Husbands and their Wives levied ≈øuch a Fine to the Cogni≈øee, and thereby granted <hi>totum &amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid habent, &amp;c.</hi> which Words were rejected, and the Iudge would not pa≈øs the Fine, becau≈øe if the Party had nothing in the Land then nothing pa≈ø≈øed; and ≈øo is <hi>44 Ed. 3. 36.</hi> By which it appears that the Iudges in tho≈øe times thought the≈øe Fines did pa≈øs no more than what the Cogni≈øor had; and for this there are multitude of Authorities in the <hi>Year Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the≈øe Words cannot have a ≈øignification to enlarge the E≈øtate granted, they ≈øerve only to explain what was intended to pa≈øs; for in the Ca≈øe at the Barr, if the Grant had b√©en <hi>totum &amp; quicquid habent in tenementis praedictis</hi> there would have been no que≈øtion of the E≈øtate granted; but the Cogni≈øors having grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>tenementa praedicta,</hi> they ≈øeem by the≈øe ≈øub≈øequent Words to recollect them≈øelves, <hi>viz. totum &amp; quicquid habent in tenemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis praedictis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:172213:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected that the Limitation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate, <hi>viz. durante vita eorum &amp; alterius eorum diutius viventis</hi> works a Di≈ø≈øei≈øin, becau≈øe by tho≈øe Words two E≈øtates for Life pa≈øs entire in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, whereas in truth there was but one E≈øtate for Life of the Husband, in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; and therefore this was more than they could grant, becau≈øe the E≈øtate Tayl came between the E≈øtate which the Husband and Wife had for their Lives and for the Survivor of them, and the E≈øtate which the Husband had for his own Life.</p>
               <p>And this is farther enforced by that Rule in Law, <hi>That E≈øtates ≈øhall not pa≈øs by fractions;</hi> for otherwi≈øe there can be no rea≈øon why they ≈øhould not thus pa≈øs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> But this Rule is very fallible, and not ≈øo much to be regarded; 'tis true, the Rule is ≈øo far admitted to be true, where without inconveniency E≈øtates may pa≈øs without fraction; but where there is an inconveniency it may be di≈øpen≈øed withal, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øuch an inconveniency as may appear to the Iudges to make the thing granted, to go contrary to the intent of the Parties.</p>
               <p>And that ≈øuch Interpretations have been made, agrees with the third Rea≈øon propo≈øed in this Ca≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> That it hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved countenance by judicial Opinions and determinations in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Iudgments, <hi>14 E. 4. 4. 27 H. 8. 13. 1 Co. 67. Bredons Ca≈øe,</hi> which was thus; Tenant for life, remainder in tayl to <hi>A.</hi> remainder in tayl to <hi>B.</hi> Tenant for life, and he in the fir≈øt remainder levied a Fine <hi>≈øur cogni≈øance de droit come ceo;</hi> 't was adjudged that this was no <hi>Di≈øcontinuance</hi> of either of the Remainders,<note place="margin">1 Roll. Abr. lit. I. pl. 4. 1 In≈øt. 45. a. Cro. Car. 406.</note> becau≈øe each of them gave what he might lawfully, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tenant for Life granted his E≈øtate, and the Remainder-man pa≈ø≈øed a Fee-≈øimple determinable upon his E≈øtate Tail, and yet each of their E≈øtates were ≈øtill divided.</p>
               <p>On the other ≈øide it was ≈øaid, that in all Ca≈øes where the per≈øon who hath a particular E≈øtate, takes upon him either by Feoffment in <hi>pais</hi> or by Fine, which is a Feoffment on Record, to grant a greater E≈øtate than he hath (as in this Ca≈øe is done) though po≈ø≈øibly the E≈øtate of the Grant√©e may determin before that of the Grantor, yet 'tis a di≈øplacing the Rever≈øion; as if a Man has an E≈øtate for ten Lives, and makes a Grant for the Life of another; here is a po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibility, that the E≈øtate which he granted may be longer than the E≈øtate he had in the thing granted, becau≈øe one Man may ≈øurvive the Ten, and for that rea≈øon 'tis a dive≈øting.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> In this Ca≈øe the E≈øtate which the Husband and Wife had is to be con≈øidered.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> What they granted.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:172213:63"/>
               <p>And by comparing of the≈øe together it will appear whether they granted more than they had: The Husband and Wife had an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate for the Life of the Wife, and (after the E≈øtate Tail) the Husband had an E≈øtate for his own Life, now they grant an E≈øtate for the Life of the Husband and Wife and the Survivor; What is this but one entire E≈øtate in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion? No other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation can be agr√©eable to the ≈øen≈øe of the Words; for if it had been granted according to the true E≈øtate which each had, then it ≈øhould have been, fir≈øt for the Life of the Wife, and after the Tail ≈øpent, then for the Life of the Husband.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be con≈øidered is, Whether the E≈øtate ≈øhall pa≈øs entire or by fractions? And as to that I need ≈øay no more than only to quote the Authority of that Iudgment given in <hi>Garret <hi>and</hi> Blizard's Ca≈øe, 1 Roll. Abr. 855.</hi> which is ≈øhortly thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Tenant for Life, Remainder for Life, Remainder in Tail, Remainder in Fee to the Tenant for Life in Remainder; this Tenant for Life in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder levies a Fine <hi>come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> it was adjudged a Forfeiture of his E≈øtate for Life; ≈øo that the Remainder Man in Tail might enter after the death of the Tenant for Life in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; for it ≈øhall not be intended that he pa≈ø≈øed his E≈øtate by fractions, <hi>viz.</hi> an E≈øtate in Remainder for Life and a Remainder in Fe√© expectant upon the E≈øtate Tail, but one entire E≈øtate in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; and 'tis not like the Authority in <hi>Bredon's Ca≈øe,</hi> for there the E≈øtate for Life and the E≈øtate Tail followed one another.</p>
               <p>Next it is to be con≈øidered, whether after they granted <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia illa tenementa,</hi> the ≈øub≈øequent Words <hi>&amp; totum ≈øtatum ≈øuum, &amp;c.</hi> do not come in by way of Re≈øtriction, and qualifie what went before.</p>
               <p>But tho≈øe ≈øub≈øequent Words are placed in this Fine, not by way of Re≈øtriction but of Accumulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Litt. 345</note>In <hi>Littleton Sect. 613.</hi> 'tis ≈øaid, that if Tenant in Tail grants all his E≈øtate in the Tenements, <hi>Habendum</hi> all his E≈øtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this Ca≈øe the Alienee hath but an E≈øtate for the Life of the Tenant in Tail; and 'tis ob≈øervable that <hi>totum ≈øtatum</hi> in the Ca≈øe put by <hi>Littleton</hi> is both in the Premi≈ø≈øes and the <hi>Habendum:</hi> But if I will grant <hi>tenementa praedicta</hi> in the Premi≈ø≈øes, and then make another Limitation in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> there <hi>totum ≈øtatum &amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, &amp;.</hi> can make no Re≈øtriction, if it ≈øhould, it will ≈øpoil mo≈øt Conveyances.</p>
               <p>It is agr√©ed, that if tho≈øe Words had b√©en omitted in this Ca≈øe, then by this Fine the Rever≈øion would be di≈øplaced, and therefore much weight is laid upon the≈øe Words to explain the meaning of the Parties thereby, and that when they granted <hi>tenementa praedicta</hi> they meant <hi>totum ≈øtatum, &amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:172213:63"/>
               <p>But here is no ground for ≈øuch an Interpretation; 'tis an entire Grant of the Hou≈øes by the Words <hi>Tenementa praedicta;</hi> and the ≈øub≈øequent Words ≈øhall never be allowed to make ≈øuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtriction which ≈øhall overthrow the frame of the D√©ed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> But no Authority can be produced, where a Man that had an E≈øtate for Life in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and another in Remainder, and granted by the ≈øame Words, as in this Ca≈øe, but that it was a Forfeiture.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. Object.</hi> That the Law will not make a Con≈øtruction to work a Wrong, and therefore if Tenant for Life grant generally for Life, it ≈øhall be interpreted during the Life of the Grantor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> That Ca≈øe is without expre≈øs Words, or ≈øhewing any time for which the Grantee ≈øhall have the thing granted; and therefore the Law re≈øtrains it to the Life of the Grantor, becau≈øe it will not make Words which are doubtful and of incertain ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification to do any Wrong: But where there are expre≈øs Words as in this Ca≈øe, no other Con≈øtruction can be made of them but that an E≈øtate in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion was thereby intended to pa≈øs.</p>

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Certainly no Man ever intended to make a Forfeiture of his own E≈øtate, tho≈øe are generally the effects of Ignorance and not of the Will, as the Ca≈øe of <hi>Gimlet <hi>and</hi> Sands, Cro. Car.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Roll. Abr. 856.</note> 
                  <hi>391.</hi> where Tenant in Fee makes a Feoffment to two to the u≈øe of him≈øelf for Life, then to the u≈øe of his Wife for Life, Remainder in Tail to his Son and Heir, Remainder to his own right Heirs; and afterwards he made another Feoffment to <hi>Smith</hi> with Warranty; the Mother and Son join in another Feoffment, adjudged that this was a Forfeiture of her E≈øtate for life, though ≈øhe had no notice of the Warranty made by her Husband; for the Feoffment made by him was a publick Act upon the Land, and ≈øhe ought to have taken notice of it; and though by her joining in the Feoffment with her Son, ≈øhe did not intend to forfeit her
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:172213:64"/> E≈øtate, yet the Law adjudges according to what is done: But in the Ca≈øe at Barr, the intention of the Parties may be collected by the Act done; and there is great rea≈øon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume, that the Parties thereby intended to di≈øplace the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion; for the Husband joyning in the Fine, and in the Warranty (if it was no dive≈øting) the Warranty is of no u≈øe.</p>
               <p>Another Objection has been only mentioned, which is, that admitting this ≈øhould amount to a di≈øplacing, if the E≈øtate had been in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; yet in this Ca≈øe it would not, becau≈øe it was prevented by the Lea≈øe for years in being.</p>
               <p>But that cannot hinder the execution of this Fine; 'tis a Fine <hi>≈øur conce≈ø≈øit,</hi> which is executory in its nature, and doth not pa≈øs any E≈øtate, or take any effect 'till executed, and ≈øo is the Book, <hi>41 5. 3. 14. b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this Ca≈øe the Fine was executed, which may be by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>pais,</hi> as well as by <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and as to this purpo≈øe, may be executed by the entry of the Conu≈øor,<note place="margin">1 Rep. 106. Dyer 376. b.</note> without ≈øuing out any Execution, <hi>38 Ed. 3. Brook tit. Scire facias 199.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there had been a Fine executed, there would have be√©n lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doubt left in this Ca≈øe; and by the Attornment of the Le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øee for years, it mu≈øt be admitted that this Fine was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as <hi>8 Ed. 3. f. 44.</hi> For a Fine of a Rever≈øion may be executed to all purpo≈øes by the Attornment of the Le≈ø≈øee for years; and if ≈øo, when a Fine executory is once executed, 'tis as good as a Fine <hi>≈øur Conu≈øance de droit come ceo,</hi> to make a forfeiture of the particular E≈øtate.</p>
               <p>Where a Feoffment is made, and a Lea≈øe for years is in being, the Feoffment is not good; becau≈øe in ≈øuch ca≈øe there mu≈øt be a pre≈øent tran≈øpo≈øition of the E≈øtate,<note place="margin">Po≈øtea, Moor and Pitt.</note> which is hindred by the Lea≈øe.</p>
               <p>But in ca≈øe of a Fine, which is a Feoffment upon Record, a Lea≈øe for years is no impediment or di≈øplacing of the Rever≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if Tenant in Tayl, expectant upon a Lea≈øe for years, levy a Fine, 'tis a di≈øcontinuance of the Tayl, and notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Lea≈øe, the Fine has ≈øuch an operation upon the Free-hold, that it di≈øplaces the Rever≈øion in Fee, <hi>Co. Lit. 332.</hi> And therefore if a Lea≈øe for years prevents not a Di≈øcontinuance, it will much le≈øs hinder a di≈øplacing in this ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>But no Iudgment was given now in this Ca≈øe; another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being debated, whether the Plaintiff could have Iudgment, becau≈øe he was barred by the Statute of Limitations; for it did not appear that he had been in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion for twenty years pa≈øt, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:172213:65"/> the Verdict hath not found any Claim, or that the Plaintiff was within the Provi≈øo of the Act.</p>

               <p>The Office of <hi>the Warden of the Fleet,</hi> may be taken in two capacities, either as an E≈øtate or common Hereditament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <p>As 'tis an Inheritance transferrable, 'tis ≈øubject to the Rules of Law in point of De≈øcent, and is demi≈øable for Life, in Fee, Tayl, Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion or Rever≈øion, and in many things is common, and runs parallel with other E≈øtates of Inheritance. 'Tis true, he cannot grant this Office for years, not for any di≈øability in the Grantor, but in re≈øpect of the matter and nature of the thing granted, it being an Office of Tru≈øt and Per≈øonal, for otherwi≈øe it would go to the Executor, which is inconvenient, <hi>9 Co. 96.

               <p>To enquire what ≈øuperiority the rever≈øioner hath over the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular E≈øtate is not to the point in Que≈øtion; but there is ≈øuch an intimacy and privity between them, that in Iudgment of Law they are accounted as one E≈øtate.</p>

               <p>He who is in the Office as Superiour, whether it be by <hi>droit</hi> or <hi>tort</hi> is accountable to the King and his People, and this brings him within the Statute of <hi>We≈øtm. 2. cap. 11.</hi> or <hi>1 R. 2.</hi>

               <p>If the <hi>Defendant</hi> had granted the Office in Fee to <hi>Ducken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi> before any E≈øcape had been, and the Grantee had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the <hi>Defendant</hi> then had been di≈øcharged; or if he dye before or after the Action brought and before Iudgment, <hi>moritur actio cum per≈øona,</hi> for if he had not re≈øerved ≈øomething he could not be charged, and if he had parted with the Inheritance, the privity had been gon, but by re≈øerving that, he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf liable; for now he is Superiour, he may exact Homage and Fealty, and the particular Tenant is ≈øaid to be attendant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rever≈øion, and the≈øe are marks of Superiority.</p>

               <p>The Court of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> always examine the ≈øufficiency of the Grantee for Life, which ≈øhews that in all ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of Ages the Opinions of Learned Men were, that no E≈øcape could be

               <p>But admitting the Ca≈øe of the Duke of <hi>Norkfolk</hi> to be Law, yet it concerns not this, becau≈øe the Sub Mar≈øhal there was taken as a Deputy, but there is no ≈øuch Officer as a Sub-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, for <hi>Duckenfield</hi> had it for Life.</p>
               <p>And then a Deputy being a per≈øon removable at plea≈øure, will not be ≈øo con≈øidered in Law, as one who hath a more fixed E≈øtate; for having nothing to lo≈øe, it cannot be intended that he will be ≈øo careful in the execution of his Office, as the other; and therefore 'tis rea≈øonable in ≈øuch Ca≈øe, that the Superiour ≈øhould an≈øwer: But he who hath a Freehold for Life, hath an E≈øtate of ≈øome value in the Law, which he cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed ea≈øily to forfeit, and therefore 'tis rea≈øonable that he alone ≈øhould be lyable for his own Mi≈øcarriages; for if the Defendant ≈øhould be charged, by the ≈øame rea≈øon the Grantee of the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion may be charged, who is altogether an innocent per≈øon, and ≈øo may be liable to a va≈øt Sum for the Fault of another; for which Rea≈øons he prayed Iudgment for the Defendant.</p>

               <p>But as to the main Que≈øtion they were of Opinion that the Defendant was Superior, and that he is chargeable for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øufficiency of <hi>Duckenfield;</hi> but if he had b√©en ≈øufficient when the Plaintiff brought this Action, it might have been otherwi≈øe; but his Inability being fully averred in the Declaration; and the Defendant denying it, and the Iury having found nothing again≈øt it, but there being ≈øtrong Su≈øpicions of the truth of the Fact, the Court would not make an intendment to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Or to charge with a Rent; and thus the Law continued till <hi>13 E. 1.</hi> and there having been frequent Warrs between King <hi>John</hi> and the Barons, the great Men then obtained the Statute <hi>De donis</hi> to pre≈øerve their E≈øtates, le≈øt the like occa≈øion ≈øhould happen again; in which 'tis only mentioned, that the Tenant in Tail ≈øhould not have power to alien; but it was well known, that if he could not alien, he could not forfeit, for before that Statute, as he might alien <hi>po≈øt prolem ≈øu≈øcitatam,</hi> ≈øo the Iudges always con≈øtrued that he might forfeit, <hi>5 Edw. 3.14.</hi> for forfeiture
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:172213:72"/> and alienation did always go hand in hand, <hi>1 Co. 175. Mildmay</hi>'s Ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>And from the making of that Statute, it always continued a ≈øetled and received Opinion, That Tenant in Tail could not alien, until by the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Ed. 4.</hi> a Recovery came in, by which the E≈øtate Tail may be docked, and which is now become a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon A≈ø≈øurance.</p>
               <p>Then by the Statute of <hi>4 H. 7. cap. 24.</hi> Tenant in Tail might bar his I≈ø≈øue by Fine and Proclamation, and all this while it was not thought that ≈øuch Lands could be forfeited for Trea≈øon; which Opinion continued during all the Reign of <hi>H. 7.</hi> for though by his Marriage the Hou≈øes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lanca≈øter</hi> were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet the Great Men in tho≈øe days thought there might be ≈øome doubt about the Succe≈ø≈øion, after the death of <hi>H. 7.</hi> if he ≈øhould dye without I≈ø≈øue, and thereby tho≈øe differences might be again revived, and therefore no endeavours were u≈øed to make any alteration in the Law, till after the death of <hi>H. 7.</hi> And after his Son <hi>H. 8.</hi> had I≈ø≈øue, tho≈øe doubts were removed, and being never likely to ari≈øe again, then the Act of <hi>26 H. 8.</hi> was made, which gives a Forfeiture of entailed Lands in ca≈øes of Trea≈øon.</p>
               <p>The inference from this will be, that all the Ca≈øes put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>26th</hi> year of <hi>H. 8.</hi> and ≈øo before entailed Lands were made forfeitable for Trea≈øon; and where by the <hi>general Words</hi> of Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, 'twas adjudged entailed Lands did not pa≈øs, do not concern this Ca≈øe; but now ≈øince they are made forfeitable by that Statute, ≈øuch general words are ≈øufficient to ≈øerve the turn.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of <hi>16 R. 2. cap. 5.</hi> entailed Lands are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited in a <hi>Praemunire</hi> but during the Life of Tenant in Tail; becau≈øe they were not then to be forfeited for Trea≈øon,<note place="margin">2 In≈øt. 334. 1 In≈øt. 3.</note>

               <p>If then it appears that the Crime of which Sir <hi>John Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> was guilty, was Trea≈øon; and if entailed Lands are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited for Trea≈øon, then when the Act ≈øaith, <hi>That he ≈øhall forfeit all his Lands;</hi> by tho≈øe general Words his entailed Lands ≈øhall be forfeited: And though by the Common Law there can be no Attainder in this Ca≈øe, the Party being dead; yet by Act of Parliament that may be done, and the words in this Act amount to an Attainder.</p>
               <p>The intent of it was to forfeit E≈øtates Tail, which may be collected from the general Words; for if a Fee-≈øimple is forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though not named, why not an E≈øtate Tail? e≈øpecially ≈øince the word <hi>Hereditaments</hi> is very comprehen≈øive, and may take in both tho≈øe E≈øtates, <hi>Spelman</hi>'s <hi>Glo≈ø≈øary 227. 2 Roll.

               <p>
                  <hi>Baldwin</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> argued that the Iu≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not good, becau≈øe there are two ≈øorts of Toll, <hi>viz.</hi> Toll through and Toll traver≈øe, and is in the Kings High Way, and the other in a Mans own Soil, and it doth not appear for which the Defendant hath ju≈øtified. If it be for the fir≈øt, then he ought to ≈øhew that he did make a Cau≈øeway, or ≈øome other thing that might be an advantage to the Pa≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to entitle him≈øelf to a Pre≈øcription; but if it be for the other, then he mu≈øt al≈øo ≈øhew it was for pa≈ø≈øing upon his Soil, which implies a Con≈øideration, <hi>22 A≈ø≈øize, Kelw. 148. Pl. Com. 236. Lord Berkley's Ca≈øe. 1 Cro. 710. Smith <hi>ver≈øus</hi> Sheppard;</hi> by which Ca≈øes it appears that the ju≈øtification ought to be certain.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:172213:78"/>
               <p>Then as to the point in Que≈øtion, he ≈øaid, that Toll cannot be appurtenant to a Mannor, and ≈øo the Pleading by a <hi>Que e≈øtate</hi> is not good; but if that ≈øhould be admitted, yet the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor being ve≈øted in the Crown by the di≈ø≈øolution, the Toll then became in gro≈øs, and could never after be united to the Mannor, or appurtenant thereunto.</p>
               <p>But it was argued for the Defendant by <hi>Maynard</hi> Serjeant, and the whole Court were clear of Opinion, that the I≈ø≈øue was upon a particular point, and the Title was admitted, and that nothing remained in que≈øtion but the Point in pleading. And as to what had been objected, That Toll cannot belong to a Mannor, 'tis quite otherwi≈øe; for an Advow≈øon, a Rent, a Toll, or any Profit apprender may be appurtenant to it. Tis true a Man cannot pre≈øcribe by a <hi>Que E≈øtate</hi> of a Rent, Advow≈øon, Toll, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he may of a Mannor, to which the≈øe are appendant; 'tis likewi≈øe true, that if the Defendant had ≈øaid this was Toll for pa≈ø≈øing the Highway, he mu≈øt ≈øhew ≈øome cau≈øe to entitle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to the taking of it, as by doing ≈øomething of publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>But this general way of pleading is the mo≈øt u≈øual, and ≈øo are the Pre≈øidents, and it ought to come on the other ≈øide, and to be alledged, that the Defendant pre≈øcribed for Toll in the High-way; and in this Ca≈øe, though the Mannor came to the Crown, the Toll remained appurtenant ≈øtill, and ≈øo it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when it was granted out. The difference is between a thing which was originally a Flower of the Crown, and other things which are not, as <hi>Catalla Felonum, &amp;c.</hi> if ≈øuch come again to the King, they are merged in the Crown; but 'tis otherwi≈øe in ca≈øes of a <hi>Leet, Park, Warren, Toll, &amp;c.</hi> which were fir≈øt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King, <hi>9 Co.

               </p>
               <p>But in this Ca≈øe, after the death of Sir <hi>David Cunningham</hi> the Executor, his Te≈øtator is dead Inte≈øtate; for to make an Executor there mu≈øt be fir≈øt the naming of him; then there mu≈øt be ≈øome concurring act of his own to declare his a≈ø≈øent, that he will take <hi>onus executionis</hi> upon him, for no man can make another Executor again≈øt his will; ≈øo that if after the death of the fir≈øt Executor, tho≈øe other Executors appointed by him, had made ≈øuch a Declaration, as this ≈øurviving Executor hath ≈øince done, their Te≈øtator had dyed Inte≈øtate, <hi>7 E. 4. 12, 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Executor is made by the Te≈øtator, and the Ordinary is empowered by the Statute to make the Admini≈øtrator where the per≈øon dies Inte≈øtate; ≈øo that 'tis plain there cannot be an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor and Admini≈øtrator both together: If he who is made ≈øo taketh upon him long after the Will to be Executor, it ≈øhall make him ≈øuch by relation from the time of the death of the Te≈øtator; but here is no Executor nor ever was: 'Tis true, that one was named, but as ≈øoon as he heard of the Will he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and therefore there being no Executor in this Ca≈øe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now can hinder the Admini≈øtration to be granted <hi>cum Te≈øtamento annexo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Te≈øtator ≈øhould dye indebted, or have Debts owing to him, and the Executor refu≈øes Probate, and renounces his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor≈øhip, Admini≈øtration mu≈øt be granted, for <hi>Lex fingit ubi ≈øub≈øi≈øtit Aequitas,</hi> and the Executor having a po≈ø≈øibility to be ≈øuch, and by his refu≈øal becoming no Executor, why ≈øhould the bare naming of him to be an Executor, have relation to make ≈øuch Admini≈øtration void? ≈øince 'tis not the Name, but the doing of the Office which makes him Executor, <hi>Dyer 372.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all the≈øe Executors had dyed after Admini≈øtration thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it cannot be ≈øaid that they ever were Executors.</p>
               <p>There can be no inconvenience that this Admini≈øtration ≈øhould be good; for 'tis ju≈øt that Creditors ≈øhould have their Debts, and Purcha≈øors ≈øhould be ≈øecure in the things purcha≈øed.</p>
               <p>If the Te≈øtator was indebted, an Action will lie again≈øt an Executor <hi>de ≈øon tort,</hi> for ≈øuch Debt, which Executor is altogether as wrongfull as the Admini≈øtrator, to whom Admini≈øtraton is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,

               <p>But as to that, he ≈øaid that here was an Executor appointed by the Will, who had an Intere≈øt, and Admini≈øtration being granted to another, 'tis void <hi>ab initio,</hi> and what is once void cannot be made good by any ≈øub≈øequent act,<note place="margin">Mod. Rep. 214.</note>

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:172213:80"/>
               <p>Here was a want of power in him who did this Act; for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary could not grant Admini≈øtration where there is an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and therefore no relation ≈øhall be to make that good which was once void; but if it had b√©en only voidable it might have been otherwi≈øe.</p>
               <p>A Relation may be to inable the Party to recover the Goods of the Inte≈øtate, and to puni≈øh Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes; as if a Man die po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed of Goods, and a Stranger convert them, and afterwards Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtration is granted to <hi>S.</hi> this Admini≈øtration ≈øhall<note n="*" place="margin">2 Roll Abr. 399.</note> relate to the time of the death of the Inte≈øtate, ≈øo that he may maintain Trover, before the Ordinary had committed it to him, but it will never aid the Acts of the Parties to avoid them by Relation; as if a Man makes a Feoffment to a Feme Covert, and afterwards devi≈øes the ≈øame Land, the Husband di≈øagr√©es, this ≈øhall have relation between the Parties, ≈øo as the Husband ≈øhall not be charged in damages, but it ≈øhall not make the void Devi≈øe good, <hi>3 Co. 28. b. Butler <hi>and</hi> Baker's Ca≈øe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if a Man makes a Relea≈øe, and afterwards get Letters of Admini≈øtration, that ≈øhall not relate to make his Relea≈øe good to barr him, neither ≈øhall his refu≈øal of the Executor≈øhip do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe at the time of the Relea≈øe or the refu≈øal there was not any right of Action in him; for that commences in the one Ca≈øe after Admini≈øtration, and in the other after the Probate of the Will.</p>

               <p>The Defendant before the Trial made all po≈ø≈øible ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to my Lord; he denied the ≈øpeaking the Words, and made Oath that he never ≈øpoke the ≈øame; after the Trial he likewi≈øe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øed to my Lord as before, making ≈øeveral Prote≈øtations of his Innocency: But having once in a Pa≈ø≈øion ≈øaid, that he ≈øcorned to ≈øubmit; My Lord for that Rea≈øon would not remit the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; it was therefore moved for a new Tryal upon the≈øe Rea≈øons.</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> Becau≈øe the Witne≈ø≈øes, who proved the Words, were not Per≈øons of Credit, and that at the time, when they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ≈øpoken, many Clergy-men were in Company with the Defendant and heard no ≈øuch Words ≈øpoken.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> It was ≈øworn, that one of the Iury confe≈ø≈øed, that they gave ≈øuch great damages to the Plaintiff (not that he was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified ≈øo much) but that he might have the greater opportunity to ≈øhew him≈øelf noble in the remitting of them.</p>

               <p>The Chief Iu≈øtice <hi>North</hi> ≈øaid, In Ca≈øes of Fines for criminal Matters a Man is to be fined by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> with a <hi>≈øalvo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenemento ≈øuo;</hi> and no Fine is to be impo≈øed greater than he is able to pay; but in Civil Actions the Plaintiff is to recover by way of compen≈øation for the damages he hath ≈øu≈øtained, and the Iury are the proper Iudges thereof.</p>
               <p>This is a Civil Action brought by the Plaintiff for Words ≈øpoken of him, which if they are in their own nature actionable, the Iury ought to con≈øider the damage which the Party may ≈øu≈øtain; but if a particular Averment of ≈øpecial damages makes them actionable, then the Iury are only to con≈øider ≈øuch damages as are already ≈øu≈øtained, and not ≈øuch as may happen <hi>in futuro,</hi> becau≈øe for ≈øuch the Plaintiff may have a new Action: He ≈øaid that as a Iudge he could not tell what value to ≈øet upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:172213:81"/> of the Plaintiff, the Iury have given <hi>4000 l.</hi> and therefore he could neither le≈ø≈øen the Sum or grant a new Trial, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ≈øince by the Law the Iury are Iudges of the damages; and it would be very inconvenient to examine upon what account they gave their Verdict; they having found the Defendant guilty did believe the Witne≈ø≈øes, and he could not now make a doubt of their Credibility.</p>

               <p>The Iury in this Ca≈øe ought to have re≈øpect only to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which the Plaintiff ≈øu≈øtained, and not to do an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing that he might have an opportunity to ≈øhew him≈øelf generous; and as the Court ought with one Eye to look upon the Verdict, ≈øo with the other they ought to take notice what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Declaration, and then to con≈øider whether the Words and Damages bear any proportion, if not, then the Court ought to lay their hands upon the Verdict: 'Tis true they cannot le≈ø≈øen the damages, but if they are too great the Court may grant a new Tryal.</p>

                  <hi>Scroggs</hi> Iu≈øtice accorded with <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Wyndham,</hi> that no new Tryal can be granted in this Cau≈øe: He ≈øaid that he was of Council with the Plaintiff before he was called to the Bench, and might therefore be ≈øuppo≈øed to give Iudgment in favour of his former Client, being prepo≈ø≈øe≈øs'd in the Cau≈øe, or el≈øe (to ≈øhew him≈øelf more ≈øignally ju≈øt) might without con≈øidering the matter give Iudgment again≈øt him; but that now he had forgot all former relation thereunto, and therefore delivered his Opinion, that if he had been of the Iury he ≈øhould not have given ≈øuch a Verdict, and if he had been Plaintiff he would not take advantage of it, but would overcome with Forgivene≈øs ≈øuch Follies and Indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions of which the Defendant had been guilty; but that he did not ≈øit there to give Advice, but to do Iu≈øtice to the People. He did agr√®e that where an unequal Tryal was, (as ≈øuch mu≈øt be where there is any Practice with the Iury) in ≈øuch Ca≈øe 'tis good rea≈øon to grant a new Tryal, but no ≈øuch thing appearing to him in this Ca≈øe a new Tryal could not be granted.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:172213:82"/>
               <p>Suppo≈øe the Iury had given a ≈øcandalous Verdict for the Plaintiff, as a Penny Damages, he could not have obtained a new Trial in hopes to increa≈øe them, neither ≈øhall the Defendant in hopes to le≈ø≈øen them; and therefore by the Opinion of the≈øe three Iu≈øtices a new Tryal was not granted.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in this Term Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> moved in Arre≈øt of Iudgment, and ≈øaid, that this Action was grounded upon the Statute of <hi>R. 2.</hi> Which con≈øi≈øts of a Preamble, reciting the Mi≈øchief, and of the Enacting part in giving of a Remedy, and that the Defendants Ca≈øe was neither within the Mi≈øchief or the Remedy.</p>
               <p>This Statute doth not create any Action by way of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar de≈øign, and if the matter was now <hi>Res integra</hi> much might be ≈øaid that an Action for Damages will not lye upon this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; for the Statute of <hi>We≈øtm. 2.</hi> appoints that the Offender ≈øhall ≈øuffer impri≈øonment, until he produces the Author of a fal≈øe Report;<note place="margin">Ca. 33.</note> and the Statute of <hi>2 R. 2.</hi> which recites that of <hi>We≈øtm. 2.</hi> gives the ≈øame puni≈øhment, and the Action is brought <hi>qui tam, &amp;c.</hi> and yet the Plaintiff only recovers for him≈øelf: It was u≈øual to puni≈øh Offenders in this kind in the <hi>Star Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> as in the * Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Ca≈øe, where one <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> ≈øaid of him, <hi>That he wrote a Book again≈øt <hi>Garnet,</hi> and a Letter to <hi>Bellarmine;</hi>

                  <note place="margin">12 Co. 132.</note> intimating, that what he wrote in the Book was not his Opinion, but only <hi>ad captandum populum,</hi> which was a great di≈øgrace to him in tho≈øe days, being as much as to ≈øay, he was a Papi≈øt, <hi>Cro. Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Serjeant would not in≈øi≈øt upon that now, ≈øince it hath been ruled that where a Statute prohibits the doing of a thing which if done might be prejudicial to another; in ≈øuch ca≈øe he may have an Action upon that very Statute for his Damages.</p>
               <p>But the ground on which he argued was, that the≈øe words as ≈øpoken are not within the meaning of the Act, for they are not actionable.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Becau≈øe they are no ≈øcandal, and words which are actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable mu≈øt import a great Scandal, which no circum≈øtance or occa≈øion of ≈øpeaking can excu≈øe; and if they are ≈øcandalous and capable of any mitigation by the precedent di≈øcour≈øe, the pleading of that matter will make them not actionable; and for this the Lord<note n="*" place="margin">4 Co.</note> 
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Ca≈øe is a plain Authority, the Words ≈øpoken of him were, <hi>You like tho≈øe that maintain Sedition again≈øt the King's Per≈øon;</hi> the occa≈øion of ≈øpeaking of which was to give an account of his favouring the Puritan Preachers, which was all that was intended by the former di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe; for that Lord had approved a Sermon which was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:172213:82"/> by a Par≈øon again≈øt the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> Book, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant having forbid ≈øuch Preaching, the Lord told him <hi>that he did not like him,</hi> upon which he ≈øpoke tho≈øe Words; ≈øo that the ≈øubject matter explained the ≈øen≈øe, for which rea≈øon it was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Action would not lie.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The ≈øcandal for which an Action may be brought within this Statute mu≈øt be <hi>fal≈øe,</hi> for that word goes quite through the whole Act, <hi>viz. fal≈øe News, fal≈øe Lyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> and the words here are ≈øo general, that it cannot appear whether they are true or fal≈øe, for there can be no Iu≈øtification here; as in ca≈øe where a Man is charged with a particular Crime, my Lord <hi>Town≈øend</hi> is not charged with any particular Act of Inju≈øtice as a Subject, nor with any Misdemeanour as a Peer, nor with any Offence in an Office.</p>
               <p>If therefore in all Actions brought upon this Statute the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may ju≈øtifie and put the matter in I≈ø≈øue to try whether it be true or fal≈øe; and in this Ca≈øe the Defendant can neither ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie nor traver≈øe, for this rea≈øon the Action will not lie.</p>
               <p>That the Words are general and of a doubtful ≈øignification, it cannot be denied; for to ≈øay <hi>He is an unworthy Man</hi> imports no particular Crime; <hi>Unworthy</hi> is a term of Relation, as he is unworthy of my Friend≈øhip, Acquaintance or Kindred, and ≈øo may be applicable to any thing; and a Lord may in many things be unworthy of a particular Mans Friend≈øhip, as if he promi≈øes to pay a Sum of Mony at a day certain, and faileth in the payment, (as 'tis often ≈øe√©n,) ≈øuch is an unworthy Man, but that will not bear an Action: He is an unworthy Man who invites another to Dinner to affront him; but it will not bear an Action to ≈øay, <hi>That a Lord invited me to a Dinner to abu≈øe me;</hi> neither will it be actionable to ≈øay, <hi>He is an unworthy Man,</hi> becau≈øe ≈øuch in≈øtances may be given of his Vnworthine≈øs which will not bear an Action. If my Lord had be√©n compared to any ba≈øe and unworthy thing, the≈øe Words might have b√©en actionable; and that was the Ca≈øe of the Lord Marque≈øs of <hi>Dorche≈øter,</hi> it being ≈øaid of him, <hi>That there was no more value in him than in a Dog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then to ≈øay, <hi>A Man acts again≈øt Law,</hi> this is no Scandal, becau≈øe every Man who breaks a Penal Law, and ≈øuffers the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, is not guilty of any Crime. The Statute commands the burying in Woollen, the Party buries one of his Family in Linnen; in this he acts again≈øt the Law, but if the Penalty is ≈øatisfied, the Law is ≈øo likewi≈øe.</p>
               <p>A Man who acts again≈øt Law acts again≈øt Rea≈øon, becau≈øe <hi>Lex e≈øt ≈øumma ratio;</hi> but no in≈øtance is here given wherein he did thus act: 'Tis not ≈øaid, that he did act again≈øt Law wilfully, or that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:172213:83"/> he u≈øed to do any thing again≈øt Law; and ≈øo cannot be like the Ca≈øe of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who brought an Action for the≈øe Words, <hi>viz. You are u≈øed to do things again≈øt Law, and put Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into a Ca≈øtle where they cannot be replevied;</hi> for there was not only an V≈øage charged upon him, but a particular in≈øtance of Oppre≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>This Action lies for Words ≈øpoken of a Iudge of either Bench, and of a Bi≈øhop, as well as of a Peer. Now if a Man ≈øhould ≈øay, <hi>A Judge acted again≈øt Law,</hi> will an Action lie? Becau≈øe a Iudge may do a thing again≈øt Law, and yet very ju≈øtly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly, unle≈øs all the Iudges were infallible, and could not be ≈øubject to any mi≈øtakes, which none will deny.</p>
               <p>So if a Bi≈øhop return the Cau≈øe of his Refu≈øal to admit a Clerk <hi>quia crimino≈øus,</hi> this is a Return again≈øt Law, becau≈øe 'tis too general; but if <hi>J. S.</hi> ≈øhould ≈øay, <hi>A Bi≈øhop acted again≈øt Law, and ≈øhew that for Cau≈øe,</hi> an Action would not lye. If the the Lord <hi>Town≈øend</hi> had commanded his Bayliff to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈øs without Cau≈øe, that had been acting again≈øt Law and Rea≈øon.</p>
               <p>He agreed the Words to be uncivil, but not actionable; for if ≈øuch Con≈øtruction ≈øhould be made, a Man mu≈øt talk in Print, or otherwi≈øe not ≈øpeak any thing of a Peer for fear of an Action.</p>
               <p>There are many Authorities where a P√©er ≈øhall not have an Action for every trivial and ≈ølight Expre≈ø≈øion ≈øpoken of him.</p>
               <p>As to ≈øay of a P√©er, <hi>He keeps none but Rogues and Ra≈øcals about him like him≈øelf;</hi> by the Opinion of two Iu≈øtices, <hi>Yelverton</hi> and <hi>Flemming,</hi> the Action would not lie, becau≈øe they are Words of Scolding; and this was the Ca≈øe of the Earl of <hi>Lincoln, Cro. Jac. 196.</hi> But the Court was divided; the Defendant died, and ≈øo the Writ abated.</p>
               <p>Actions for Words have b√©en of late too much extended; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly there were not above two or three brought in many years; and if this Statute ≈øhould be much inlarged the Lords them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves will be prejudiced thereby by maintaining Actions one again≈øt another.</p>
               <p>Vpon this Statute of <hi>2 R. 2 c. 5</hi> there was no Action brought till <hi>13 H. 7.</hi> which was above an hundred years after the making of that Law; and the occa≈øion of making the Law was, becau≈øe the Duke of <hi>Lanca≈øter,</hi> who was then the fir≈øt Prince of the Blood, took notice that divers were ≈øo hardy as to ≈øpeak of him ≈øeveral lying Words, <hi>1 R. 2. num. 56.</hi> and therefore this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was made to puni≈øh tho≈øe, who devi≈øed <hi>fal≈øe News, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fal≈øe Lies of any Peer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby Di≈øcords might ari≈øe between the Lords and Commons, and great Peril and Mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:172213:83"/> to the Realm and quick Subver≈øion thereof:</hi> Now from the natural intent and con≈øtruction of the≈øe Words in the Act, can it be ≈øuppo≈øed that if one ≈øhould ≈øay, <hi>Such a Peer is an unworthy Man,</hi> that the Kingdom would be pre≈øently in a flame and turned into a ≈øtate of confu≈øion and Civil War; and to ≈øay, <hi>That he acts again≈øt Law,</hi> that the Government would thereby be in danger to be lo≈øt, and quick Subver≈øion would follow? This cannot be the common and ordinary under≈øtanding of the≈øe Words.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Plaintiff by ≈øpeaking the≈øe Words was in no hazard nor any wi≈øe damnified; if he was not touched in his Loyalty as a P√©er, nor in danger of his Life as a Subject; if he was not thereby ≈øubjected to any Corporal or Pecuniary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment; nor charged with any Breach of Oath, nor with a particular Mi≈øcarriage in any Office; if the Words are ≈øo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that they import no Scandal, and are neither capable of any Iu≈øtification; and la≈øtly, if they are not ≈øuch horrible Lies as are intended to be puni≈øhed by the Statute; for the≈øe Rea≈øons he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Action would not lie, and therefore prayed, that the Iudgment might be arre≈øted.</p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Baldwin</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Barrel</hi> argued on the ≈øame ≈øide for the Defendant, but nothing was mentioned by them which is not fully in≈øi≈øted on in the Argument of Serjeant <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> for which Rea≈øon I have not reported their Arguments.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pemberton</hi> Serjeant, who argued for the Plaintiff, ≈øaid,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> that it would conduce much to the under≈øtanding of the Statute of <hi>2 R. 2. cap. 5.</hi> upon which this Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> was grounded, to con≈øider the occa≈øion of the making of it.</p>
               <p>In tho≈øe days the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> were quite of another Nature and Genius from what they are at this time; the Con≈øtitution of this Kingdom was then Martial and given to Arms, the very Tenures were Military, and ≈øo were the Services as Knights Service, Ca≈øtleguard and E≈øcuage. There were many Ca≈øtles of defence in tho≈øe days in the hands of private Men; their Sports and Pa≈øtimes were ≈øuch as Tilts and Turnaments, and all their Imployments were tending to br√©ed them up in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe who had any dependency upon Noble Men were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to Bows and Arrows, and to ≈øignalize them≈øelves in Valour it was the only way to Riches and Honour; Arts and Sciences had not got ≈øuch ground in the Kingdom as now; but the Commons had almo≈øt their dependance upon the Lords, who≈øe Power then was exce√©ding great, and their Practices were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:172213:84"/> to their Power; and this is the true Rea≈øon why ≈øo few Actions were formerly brought for Scandals, becau≈øe when a Man was injured by Words he carved out his own Remedy by his Sword.</p>
               <p>There are many Statutes made again≈øt riding privately armed, which Men u≈øed in tho≈øe days, to repair them≈øelves of any Injury done unto them, for they had immediately recour≈øe to their Arms for that purpo≈øe, and ≈øeldom or never u≈øed to bring any Actions for damages.</p>
               <p>This was their Revenge; and having thus made them≈øelves Iudges in their own Ca≈øes, it was rea≈øonable that they ≈øhould do them≈øelves Iu≈øtice with their own Weapons; but this Revenge did not u≈øually end in private Quarrels, they took Parties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their Friends, their Tenants and Servants on their ≈øides, and by ≈øuch means made great Factions in the Commonwealth, by rea≈øon whereof the whole Kingdom was often in a flame, and the Government as often in danger of being ≈øubverted; ≈øo that Laws were then made again≈øt wearing Liverys or Badges, and again≈øt riding armed.</p>
               <p>This was the mi≈øchief of tho≈øe times; to prevent which this Statute of <hi>R. 2.</hi> was made, and therefore all provoking and vilifying Words, which were u≈øed before to exa≈øperate the Peers and to make them betake them≈øelves to Arms, by the intent of this Act are clearly forbidden, which was made chiefly to prevent ≈øuch con≈øequences; for it was to no purpo≈øe to make a Law and thereby to give a P√©er an Action for ≈øuch Words as a common per≈øon might have before the making of the Statute; and for which the Peer him≈øelf had a Remedy al≈øo at the Common Law, and therefore needed not the help of this Act.</p>
               <p>If then the de≈øign of this Statute was to hinder ≈øuch practices as afore≈øaid, the next thing to be con≈øidered is what was u≈øual in tho≈øe days to rai≈øe the Pa≈ø≈øions of Peers to that degre√©, and that will appear to be not only ≈øuch things as imported a great Scandal in them≈øelves, or ≈øuch for which an Action lay at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, but even ≈øuch things as ≈øavoured of any Contempt of their per≈øons; and ≈øuch as brought them into di≈øgrace with the Commons, for hereby they took occa≈øion of Provocation and Revenge.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that very few Actions were brought upon this Statute in ≈øome con≈øiderable time after it was made, for though ≈øuch practices were thereby prohibited, the Lords did not pre≈øently apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to the Remedy therein given, but continued the Military way of Revenge to which they had b√©en accu≈øtomed.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:172213:84"/>
               <p>As to the fir≈øt Objection that hath been made, he gave no an≈øwer to it, becau≈øe it was not much in≈øi≈øted upon on the other ≈øide, whether an Action would lye upon this Statute, for the very words of it are ≈øufficient ground for an Action; and 'tis very well known that whereever an Act prohibits an evil thing,<note place="margin">Maxim.</note> the per≈øon again≈øt whom ≈øuch thing is done, may maintain an Action.</p>

               <p>And ≈øo are the Words for which this Action is brought, they are rude, uncivil, and ill natured; <hi>Unworthy</hi> is as much as to ≈øay ba≈øe and ignoble, a contemptible Per≈øon, and a Man of neither Honour or Merit. And thus to ≈øpeak of a Nobleman, is a Reflection upon the King, who is the Fountain of Honour, that gives it to ≈øuch per≈øons who are (in his Iudgment) de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by which they are made capable of advi≈øing him in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and it would be very di≈øhonourable to call unworthy Men thither.</p>
               <p>'Tis likewi≈øe a di≈øhonour to the Nobility to have ≈øuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to fit among them as a Companion, and to the Commons to have their proceedings in Parliament tran≈ømitted to ≈øuch Pe√©rs: ≈øo that it tends to the di≈øhonour of all Dignities, both of King, Lords and Commons, and thereby di≈øcords may ari≈øe between the two Hou≈øes, which is the Mi≈øchief intended to be remedied by this Act.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:172213:85"/>
               <p>Then the following Words are as ≈øcandalous; for to ≈øay <hi>A Man acts again≈øt Law and Rea≈øon,</hi> imports ≈øeveral ≈øuch acts done; a Man is not denominated to be unworthy by doing of one ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Act; for in the≈øe Words more is implied, than to ≈øay <hi>he hath done an unworthy thing;</hi> for the Words ≈øeem to relate to the Office which the Plaintiff had in the Country, as Lord Lieutenant, which is an Office of great Honour, and can any thing tend to cau≈øe more di≈øcord and di≈øturbance in the Kingdom, than to ≈øay of a great Officer, <hi>That he acts according to the dictates of his Will and Plea≈øure?</hi> the con≈øequence of which is, that he will be rather ≈øcorned than obeyed.</p>
               <p>It hath been objected, that the Words are general, and charge him not with any act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The Scandal is the greater; for 'tis not ≈øo bad to ≈øay <hi>A Man did ≈øuch a particular thing again≈øt Law and Rea≈øon;</hi> as to ≈øay, <hi>He acts again≈øt Law;</hi> which is as much as to ≈øay, his con≈øtant cour≈øe and practice is ≈øuch: And to ≈øay that the Words might be meant of breaking a Penal Law, that is a foreign Con≈øtruction; for the plain ≈øen≈øe is, he acts again≈øt the known Laws of the Kingdom, and his practice and de≈øigns are ≈øo to do, for he will be guided neither by Law or Rea≈øon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It has been objected that the Scandal mu≈øt be fal≈øe: But whether true or not, there can be no ju≈øtification here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are ≈øo general, that they cannot be put in I≈ø≈øue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> He agreed that no Action would lye upon this Statute if the words were true; but in ≈øome Ca≈øes the divulging of a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal was an Offence at the Common Law; now to argue (as on the other ≈øide) that the Defendant cannot ju≈øtifie, and therefore an Action will not lye, is a fal≈øe Con≈øequence; becau≈øe words may be ≈øcandalous and derogatory to the dignity of a Peer, and yet the ≈øubject matter may not be put in I≈ø≈øue.</p>
               <p>He agreed al≈øo that occa≈øional Circum≈øtances may extenuate and excu≈øe the Words, though ill in them≈øelves; but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applied to the Ca≈øe in que≈øtion, becau≈øe the Words were not mitigated: The Defendant pleaded Not Guilty, and in≈øi≈øted on his Innocence; the Iury have found him Guilty, which is an aggravation of his Crime; if he would have extenuated them by any occa≈øion upon which they were ≈øpoken, he ≈øhould have pleaded it ≈øpecially, or offered it in Evidence, neither of which was done.</p>
               <p>This Act is to be taken favourably for him again≈øt whom the Words are ≈øpoken; becau≈øe 'tis to prevent great Mi≈øchiefs which may fall out in the Kingdom, by rude and uncivil di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes; and in ≈øuch Ca≈øes 'tis u≈øual for Courts rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:172213:85"/> the remedy than to admit of any extenuation; for which rea≈øons he prayed that the Plantiff might have his Iudgment.</p>
               <p>It was argued by Serjeant <hi>Calthrop</hi> on the ≈øame ≈øide, and to the ≈øame effect.</p>
               <p>Afterwards this Term, all the Iudges argued this Ca≈øe,<note place="margin">Argument at the Bench.</note> 
                  <hi>≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatim</hi> at the Bench. And fir≈øt Iu≈øtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> ≈øaid, That the greatne≈øs of the Damages given ≈øhould not prevail with him, either on the one ≈øide or the other; at the Common Law no Action would lye for ≈øuch Words, though ≈øpoken of a Peer, for ≈øuch Actions were not formerly much countenanced; but now ≈øince a Remedy is given by the Statute, Words ≈øhould not be con≈øtrued either in a rigid or mild ≈øen≈øe, but according to the genuine and natural meaning, and agreeable to the common under≈øtanding of all Men.</p>
               <p>At the Barr the ≈øtrained ≈øen≈øe for the Plaintiff is, that the≈øe Words import <hi>He is no Man of Honour;</hi> and for the Defendant, that they import <hi>no Scandal;</hi> and that no more was meant by them, but what may be ≈øaid of every Man.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, in re≈øpect of God Almighty, we are all Vnworthy, but the ≈øub≈øequent Clau≈øe explains what unworthine≈øs the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant intended, for he infers him to be <hi>Unworthy, becau≈øe he acts again≈øt Law and Rea≈øon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whether the Words thus explained fix any Crime on the Plaintiff, is next to be con≈øidered; and he was of Opinion that they did fix a Crime upon him; for to ≈øay <hi>He is an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Man,</hi> is as much as to ≈øay, <hi>He is a vitious per≈øon,</hi> and is the ≈øame as to call him <hi>a corrupt Man,</hi> which in the Ca≈øe of a Peer is actionable; for general words are ≈øufficient to ≈øupport ≈øuch an Action, though not for a common per≈øon.</p>
               <p>To ≈øay, <hi>a Man acts again≈øt Law and Rea≈øon,</hi> is no Crime, if he do it ignorantly; and therefore if he had ≈øaid <hi>My Lord was a weak Man, for he acts again≈øt Law and Rea≈øon;</hi> ≈øuch words had not been actionable; but the≈øe Words as ≈øpoken do not relate to his Vnder≈øtanding, but to his Morals; they relate to him al≈øo as a Peer (though the contrary has been objected) that they relate to him only as a Man, which is too nice a di≈øtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for to di≈øtingui≈øh between a Man and his Peerage, is like the di≈øtinction between the per≈øon of the King, and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which hath been often exploded; the words affect him in all qualities, and all relations.</p>
               <p>It has been al≈øo objected, that the Words are too general; and like the Ca≈øe of the Bi≈øhops Return, that a Man is <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øus,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:172213:86"/> which is not good: But though they are general in the Ca≈øe of a Peer, they are actionable; for to ≈øay of a Bi≈øhop <hi>That he is a wicked Man,</hi> the≈øe are as general words, and yet an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will lye.</p>
               <p>It has been al≈øo objected, That general Words cannot be ju≈øtified; but he was of another Opinion, as if the Plaintiff, who was Lord Lieutenant of the County, had laid an unequal charge upon a Man, who upon complaint made to him, ordered ≈øuch charge to ≈øtand, and that his will in ≈øuch ca≈øe ≈øhould be a Law: If the per≈øon ≈øhould thereupon ≈øay <hi>That the Lord had done Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, and both again≈øt Law and Rea≈øon;</hi> tho≈øe words might have been ju≈øtified, by ≈øhewing the ≈øpecial matter, either in Pleading or Evidence.</p>
               <p>'Tis too late now to examine whether an Action will lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Statute, that mu≈øt be taken for granted, and therefore was not much in≈øi≈øted on by tho≈øe who argued for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, for the Authorities are very plain, that ≈øuch Actions have been allowed upon this Statute.</p>
               <p>The Words, as here laid to be ≈øpoken, are not ≈øo bad as the Defendant might ≈øpeak, but they are ≈øo bad that an Action will lye for them; and though they are general, yet many Ca≈øes might be put of general words which import a Crime, and were adjudged actionable.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Leice≈øter</hi>'s Ca≈øe, <hi>He is an Oppre≈ø≈øor:</hi> The Lord of <hi>Winche≈øter's</hi> Ca≈øe, <hi>He kept me in Pri≈øon 'till I gave him a Relea≈øe;</hi> the≈øe words were held actionable, becau≈øe the plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from them is, <hi>That they were Oppre≈ø≈øors:</hi> The Lord <hi>Abergavenny</hi>'s Ca≈øe, <hi>He ≈øent for me and put me into Little Ea≈øe:</hi> It might be pre≈øumed, that that Lord was a Iu≈øtice of Peace, as mo≈øt Peers are in their Counties, and that what he did was by colour of his Authority; ≈øo are all the Ca≈øes cited by tho≈øe who argued for the Plaintiff, in ≈øome of which the words were ≈øtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to import a Crime, and yet adjudged actionable; e≈øpecially in the Ca≈øe of the Lord Marque≈øs of <hi>Dorche≈øter, He is to be valued no more than a Dog,</hi> which are le≈øs ≈ølanderous Words than tho≈øe at the Bar, becau≈øe the ≈ølander is more direct and po≈øitive.</p>
               <p>It appears by all the≈øe Ca≈øes, that the Iudges have always con≈øtrued in favour of the≈øe Actions, and this has been done in all probability to prevent tho≈øe dangers that otherwi≈øe might en≈øue if the Lords ≈øhould take revenge them≈øelves; for which rea≈øons he held the Action will lye.</p>

               <p>The Offences to be puni≈øhed by this Act, are <hi>mala in ≈øe,</hi> and tho≈øe are Offences again≈øt the Moral Law; they mu≈øt be ≈øuch in their nature, as bearing of fal≈øe Witne≈øs; and the≈øe are Offences again≈øt a common Per≈øon, which he admitted to be aggravated by the eminency of the per≈øon again≈øt whom they were ≈øpoke; but every uncivil Word, or rude Expre≈ø≈øion ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, even of a Great Man, will not bear an Action; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Action will not lie upon this Statute for every fal≈øe Lye, but it mu≈øt be horrible as well as fal≈øe, and ≈øuch as were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhable in the High Commi≈ø≈øion Court, which were enormous Crimes, <hi>12 Co. 43.</hi>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:172213:87"/> Words were actionable or not; and he was of Opinion, that the Statute did not extend to Words of a ≈ømall and trivial nature, nor to all Words which were actionable, but only to ≈øuch which were of a greater magnitude, ≈øuch by which Di≈øcord might ari≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lords and Commons, to the great peril of the Realm, and ≈øuch which were great Slanders, and horrible Lies, which are words purpo≈øely put into this Statute, for the aggravation and di≈øtinction of the Crime; and therefore ≈øuch Words which are actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable at the Common Law, may not be ≈øo within this Statute, becau≈øe not horrible great Scandals.</p>
               <p>He did not deny, but that the≈øe were undecent and uncivil words, and very ill applied to that honourable per≈øon of whom they were ≈øpoken, but no body could think that they were horrible great ≈ølanders, or that any debate might ari≈øe between the Lords and Commons, by rea≈øon ≈øuch words were ≈øpoken of this Peer, or that it ≈øhould tend to the great peril of the Kingdom, and the quick de≈øtruction thereof, ≈øuch as the≈øe were not likely to be the effects and con≈øequences of the≈øe Words, and therefore could not be within the meaning of the Act, becau≈øe they do not agree with the di≈øcription given in it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Here is no new puni≈øhment inflicted on the Offender, for at the Common Law, any per≈øon for ≈øuch Offences as herein are de≈øcribed might have been Fined and Impri≈øoned, either upon Indictment or Information brought again≈øt him, and no other puni≈øhment is given here but Impri≈øonment.</p>

               <p>In this Ca≈øe 'tis ≈øaid, the Plaintiff <hi>acts again≈øt Law,</hi> which doth not imply a Habit in him ≈øo to do; and when Words may as well be taken in a mild, as in a ≈øevere Sen≈øe, the Rule is <hi>quod in mitiori ≈øen≈øu accipienda ≈øunt.</hi> Now the≈øe Words are capable of ≈øuch a favourable con≈øtruction; for no more was ≈øaid of the Plaintiff, than what in ≈øome ≈øen≈øe may be ≈øaid of every per≈øon what≈øoever; for who can boa≈øt of his Innocency? who keeps clo≈øe in all his actions to Law and Rea≈øon? and to ≈øay <hi>A Man acts again≈øt both,</hi> may imply that he departed from tho≈øe Rules in ≈øome particular Ca≈øes, where it was the Error of his Iudgment only.</p>

               <p>The Law doth bear with the Infirmities of Men, as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Honour and Vertue doth in other Ca≈øes; and among≈øt all the excellent Qualities which Adorn the Nobility of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, none doth ≈øo much as forgiving of Injuries; <hi>Solomon</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>That 'tis the Honour of a Man to pa≈øs by an Infirmity.</hi> Which if the Plaintiff ≈øhould refu≈øe, yet the Defendant (if he thinks the Damages exce≈ø≈øive) is not without his remedy by Attaint, for he ≈øaid he could ≈øhew where an Attaint was brought again≈øt a Iury for giving <hi>60 l.</hi> Damages.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:172213:88"/>
               <p>He farther ≈øaid, that he could not find that any Iudgment had been either rever≈øed or arre≈øted upon this Statute, and therefore it was fit that the Law ≈øhould be ≈øetled by ≈øome Rule, becau≈øe 'tis a wretched condition for People to live under ≈øuch Circum≈øtances, as not to know how to demean them≈øelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a P√©er; and ≈øince no Limits have been hitherto pre≈øcribed 'tis fit there ≈øhould be ≈øome now, and that the Court ≈øhould go by the ≈øame Rules in the Ca≈øe of a Peer, as in that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon per≈øon, that is, not to con≈øtrue the Words actionable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øome particular Crime charged upon the Plaintiff, or unle≈øs he alledge ≈øpecial damages; for which Rea≈øons he held that this Action would not lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wyndham</hi> Iu≈øtice accorded with <hi>Scroggs;</hi> and the Chief Iu≈øtice <hi>North</hi> agreed with them in the ≈øame Opinion; his Argument was, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, he ≈øaid that he did not wonder that the Defendant made his Ca≈øe ≈øo ≈øolemn, being loaded with ≈øo great damages; but that his Opinion ≈øhould not be guided with that or with any Rules, but tho≈øe of Law, becau≈øe this did not concern the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff alone, but was the Ca≈øe of all the Nobility of <hi>England;</hi> but let it be never ≈øo general, and the Conveniences or Incoveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences never ≈øo great, he would not upon any ≈øuch con≈øiderations alter the Law.</p>
               <p>He ≈øaid that no Action would lie upon this Statute, which would not lie at the Common Law; for where a Statute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits a thing generally, and no particular Man is concerned, an Offence again≈øt ≈øuch a Law is puni≈øhable by Indictment; but where there is a particular damage to any per≈øon by doing the thing prohibited, there an Action will lie upon the Statute, and ≈øo it will at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>The Words therefore which are actionable upon this Statute are ≈øo at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>This Statute extends only to Peers or other great Officers; now every Peer as ≈øuch is a great Officer, he has an Office of great Dignity, he is to ≈øupport the King by his advice, of which he is made capable by the great Eminency of his Reputation, and therefore all Words which reflect upon him as he is the Kings Councellor, or as he is a Man of Honour and Dignity, are action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>In the ordinary Ca≈øes of Officers 'tis not nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øay that the Words were ≈øpoken relating to his Office, as to ≈øay of a Lawyer that <hi>He is a Sot or an Ignoramus;</hi> or of a Trade≈øman, <hi>He is a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:172213:89"/> Bankrupt,</hi> the Action lies though the Words were not ≈øpoken of either as a Lawyer or Trade≈øman.</p>
               <p>He did not think that Iudges were to teach Men by what Rules to walk other than what did relate to the particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before them, all other things are <hi>gratis dicta;</hi> neither would he allow that di≈øtinction, that an Action would not lie where a Man ≈øpoke only his Opinion; for if that ≈øhould be admitted, it would be very ea≈øie to ≈øcandalize any Man, as <hi>I think ≈øuch a Judge is corrupt,</hi> or <hi>I am of Opinion that ≈øuch a Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor is a Traytor;</hi> and can any Man doubt whether the≈øe or ≈øuch like Words are actionable or not, becau≈øe ≈øpoken only in the ≈øen≈øe of the per≈øon? 'Tis true, in ≈øome Ca≈øes where a Man ≈øpeaks his own particular di≈øe≈øteem an Action will not lie, as if I ≈øay, <hi>I care not for ≈øuch a Lord,</hi> but that differs much where a Man ≈øpeaks his Opinion with reference to a Crime; for Opinions will be ≈øpread, and will have an implicit Faith, and becau≈øe one Man believes it another will; and 'tis upon this ground that all the Ca≈øes which have been ≈øince the Statute are ju≈øtified; and ≈øo was the late Ca≈øe of<note n="*" place="margin">Sid. 233.</note> the Marque≈øs of <hi>Dorche≈øter, He is no more to be valued than the Black Dog which lies there</hi> which were Words of di≈øe≈øteem, and only the Opinion of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, in which Ca≈øe Iudgment was affirmed in a Writ of Error.</p>

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The Plaintiff now upon the Statute mu≈øt pro≈øecute <hi>tam pro Domino Rege quam pro ≈øeip≈øo,</hi> which he could not do at the Common Law.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The≈øe Words carry in them no di≈øe≈øteem.</p>

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> According to a Common Vnder≈øtanding they are Words of di≈øre≈øpect and of great di≈øe≈øteem; for 'tis as much as to ≈øay, that the Plaintiff is a Man of no Honour; he is one who lives after his own Will, and ≈øo is not fit to be employed under the King; if any precedent di≈øcour≈øe had qualified the ≈øpeaking the≈øe Words it ought to have been ≈øhewn by the Defendant, which is not done, and therefore he concluded that the Words notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding

               </p>
               <p>But Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> for the Defendant ≈øaid, that there is a difference when Letters of Admini≈øtration are granted in ca≈øe the Party die inte≈øtate, and when a Man makes a Will and therein appoints an Executor, for in that Ca≈øe the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor comes in immediately from the death of the Te≈øtator; but when a Man dies inte≈øtate the Ordinary hath an Intere≈øt in the Goods, and therefore he who takes them is <hi>Executor de ≈øon tort,</hi> and may be charged as ≈øuch; but 'tis otherwi≈øe generally, where there is a Will and a rightful Executor, who proveth the ≈øame, for he may bring a Trover again≈øt the Party for taking of the Te≈øtators Goods though he never had the actual po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of them; and therefore the taking in ≈øuch ca≈øe will not make a Man <hi>Executor de ≈øon tort,</hi> becau≈øe there is another lawful Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor; but 'tis true, that if there be a ≈øpecial Admini≈øtration 'tis otherwi≈øe; as if a Stranger doth take upon him to pay Debts or Legacies; or to u≈øe the Inte≈øtates Goods; ≈øuch an expre≈øs Admini≈øtration will make him <hi>Executor de ≈øon tort,</hi> and liable, as in <hi>Read's Ca≈øe, 5 Co.</hi>

               <p>Serjeant <hi>Baldwyn,</hi> who argued for the Plaintiff, held that it did lie, for though the Rent in this Ca≈øe re≈øerved did not attend the Rever≈øion, becau≈øe the Le≈ø≈øee had a≈ø≈øigned over all his Term, yet an Action of Debt will lie for that Rent upon the Contract, <hi>Cro.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:172213:93"/> that an Action of Debt will lie again≈øt him.

               <p>But if one enter as Executor <hi>de ≈øon tort,</hi> and ≈øell Goods, the Sale is good; which was not ≈øo in this Ca≈øe, becau≈øe there was a Term in Rever≈øion, whereof no Entry could be made, for which rea≈øon there could be no Executor <hi>de ≈øon tort</hi> to that, and therefore the Sale to <hi>Burge≈øs</hi> before the Admini≈øtration, was held void.</p>
               <p>And that there may be an Executor <hi>de ≈øon tort</hi> of a Term, there was a late Ca≈øe adjudged in <hi>Trin. 22 Car. 2.</hi> between <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> and <hi>Carr,</hi> which was, Le≈ø≈øee for years rendring Rent dies Inte≈øtate, his Wife takes out Letters of Admini≈øtration, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Marries a ≈øecond Husband, the Wife dies, and the Husband continues in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and receives the Profits: It was agreed, that for the Profits received he was an≈øwerable as Executor <hi>de ≈øon tort,</hi> and the Book of <hi>10 H. 11.</hi> was cited as an authority to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pemberton</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> would not undertake to an≈øwer the≈øe Points which were argued on the other ≈øide, but admitted them to be plain again≈øt him, for he did not doubt but that Debt would lie upon the Contract, where the whole Term was a≈ø≈øigned, and that there may be an Executor <hi>de ≈øon tort</hi> of a Term; but he ≈øaid, that which was the principal point in the Ca≈øe was not ≈øtirred: The que≈øtion was, whether an Action of Debt will lie again≈øt the Defendant as Executor <hi>de ≈øon tort</hi> where there is no Term at all; for 'tis plain there was none in being in this Ca≈øe, becau≈øe when the Le≈ø≈øee Re-demi≈øed his whole Term to the Le≈ø≈øor, that was a Surrender in Law, and as fully as if it had been actually ≈øurrendred; and therefore this was quite different from the Ca≈øe, where Le≈ø≈øee for years makes an A≈ø≈øignment of his whole Term to a Stranger, Debt will lie upon the Contract there, becau≈øe an Intere≈øt pa≈ø≈øes to him in Rever≈øion, and as to this purpo≈øe a Term is <hi>in e≈ø≈øe</hi> by the Contract of the Parties, and ≈øo it would here again≈øt the fir≈øt Le≈ø≈øor, who was Le≈ø≈øee upon the Re-demi≈øe; but now becau≈øe of the Surrender, the Heir is intituled to enter, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <p>If therefore Debt only lies upon the Contract of the Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as in truth it doth where the whole Term is gone, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff cannot charge any one as Executor <hi>de ≈øon tort</hi> in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the whole Term is gon here by the Re-demi≈øe, which is an ab≈øolute Surrender, and not upon Condition, for in ≈øuch Ca≈øe the Surrenderor might have entred for non-performance, and ≈øo it might have been revived: And of this Opinion was the whole Court in both points, and would not hear any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument in the Ca≈øe; the Plaintiff having no remedy at Law, the Court told him that he might ≈øeek for relief in <hi>Chancery,</hi> if he thought fit.</p>

               <p>At the Common Law the Defendant was to continue in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon till he had ≈øatisfied the Plaintiff, to whom no benefit was intended by this Statute, but rather an ea≈øe to the Defendant, that he ≈øhould be from thence di≈øcharged, giving good Bail; and the rea≈øon why the Statute mentions ≈øuch Bail is in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Sheriff al≈øo,<note place="margin">Cro Eliz. 672.</note> to ≈øecure him from Amerciaments; the Bail being then for his Indempnity, he is the ≈øole Iudge both of their per≈øons, number, and ability, for the Statute requires two Sureties, and that they ≈øhall be Men within the County; yet if there is but one, and he not of the County, and if the Bond taken by the Sheriff for the appearance of the Defendant be but 40 <hi>l.</hi> and the Debt due to the Plaintiff be 400 <hi>l.</hi> 'tis well enough,<note place="margin">2 Cro. 286.</note> becau≈øe the Statute doth not re≈øtrain him to any Sum or Sureties, for he may take what Sum he plea≈øe to force the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to appear.</p>
               <p>And when this Security is taken, the Sheriff is neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to a≈ø≈øign it to the Plaintiff, or he to take it. Tis true, he doth u≈øually a≈ø≈øign it, but that is to di≈øcharge him≈øelf of the Amerciaments, which is the way that the Plaintiff ≈øhould pur≈øue where he doth imagine the Bail to be in≈øufficient.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:172213:95"/>
               <p>If therefore this Statute was made for the benefit and ea≈øe of the Defendant, the Security therein directed is for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity of the Sheriff; and therefore if no Action will lie again≈øt him for taking of in≈øufficient Bail, 'tis as rea≈øonable that no Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øhould lie again≈øt him when he hath taken Bail, which he is compelled to do, and ≈øo the Traver≈øe in this Ca≈øe is immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and Iudgment ought to be given for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>On the other ≈øide it was argued,<note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note> That an Action of E≈øcape would lye again≈øt the Sheriff, if he did not take good Bail, which matter may be traver≈øed; and though here if the Defendant had rejoyned, the I≈ø≈øue had been, whether ≈øufficient Bail within the County or not, yet that part of the I≈ø≈øue had not been material, for the only matter had re≈øted upon the ≈øufficiency or in≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Bail in general. Like a Ca≈øe adjudged in <hi>Mich.</hi> 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>in B. R.</hi> where a Woman had power given her by her Husband to make a Will in the pre≈øence of two credible Witne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes: It was pleaded that ≈øhe made a Will in the pre≈øence of <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> credible Witne≈ø≈øes, and I≈ø≈øue was thereupon joyned,<note place="margin">Antea.</note> and it was found to be made in the pre≈øence of <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> who were credible Witne≈ø≈øes, and this was held to be good, becau≈øe the ≈øub≈øtance was found, <hi>Viz.</hi> That it was made in the pre≈øence of two credible Witne≈ø≈øes.</p>
               <p>The Defendant therefore here ought to have taken good and ≈øufficient Bail to bring him≈øelf within the Statute, and that is traver≈øable, and the Pleadings are well enough, for if there be good Bail, 'tis not material in what County they live.</p>
               <p>Vpon the fir≈øt Argument of this Ca≈øe, the Lord Chief Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice inclined that an Action of E≈øcape did lie at the Common Law again≈øt the Sheriff; for it was clear that he was to keep the Party arre≈øted in Pri≈øon 'till the Debt was ≈øatisfied, and that if he had gone at large, it had been an E≈øcape; the Sheriff then hath no excu≈øe but by this Statute, and to entitle him≈øelf to any benefit thereby, he mu≈øt pur≈øue the very directions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in pre≈øcribed, and therefore ought to take good and ≈øufficient Bail, for otherwi≈øe the Statute would be eluded, if it be left in his power to take what Bail he plea≈øes; and he was of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Plaintiff had an Intere≈øt in the Security, and therefore the Sheriff was lyable, if it was not good when fir≈øt taken, but not if by any accident afterwards the Bail mi≈øcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or become in≈øolvent.</p>
               <p>And Iu≈øtice <hi>Wyndham</hi> was of the ≈øame Opinion, that the Sheriff was lyable; he differed only as to the manner of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:172213:96"/> Action, which he held ≈øhould be a ≈øpecial Action on the Ca≈øe, ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the whole matter, and alledging that the Defendant did not take ≈øufficient Bail.</p>
               <p>Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkyns</hi> ≈øaid, the Ca≈øe depends upon the con≈øtruction of that<note n="*" place="margin">23 H. 6. cap. 10.</note> Statute, which is very ob≈øcure, and the Opinions vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous which have been upon it; 'tis plain the Sheriff is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to take Bail, and that an Action lies again≈øt him if he refu≈øes ≈øuch as are ≈øufficient when tendred; but the que≈øtion was now whether it will lie again≈øt him fortaking tho≈øe who are in≈øufficient; and as to that he ≈øaid that many Authorities were in our Books, that the taking of Bail is left to the Sheriffs di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and he is thereby to provide for his own indempnity; for he mu≈øt return a <hi>Cepi Corpus</hi> upon the Writ, he cannot return that he let him to Bail according to the Statute, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inclined that the Action did not lie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scroggs</hi> Iu≈øtice <hi>contra.</hi> He ≈øaid that this Statute de≈øigned the benefit of the Creditor, that he might either get the Sheriff amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or have an Action, in both which Ca≈øes he might indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him≈øelf by the Security he had taken. Tis true, he may let the Party to Bail, but 'tis <hi>≈øub modo,</hi> it mu≈øt be upon good Bail; and if the Sheriff be Iudge of the Security, 'tis an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that he is lyable, for if he was not in danger, he need not take Security.</p>
               <p>But afterwards upon the ≈øecond Argument, the Chief Iu≈øtice and the whole Court were of Opinion, that Iudgment ≈øhould be given for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iu≈øtice. The Common Law was very rigorous as to the execution of Proce≈øs; the <hi>Capias</hi> was <hi>ita quod habeas</hi> the Body at the day of the Return, and if the Sheriff had arre≈øted one, it had been an E≈øcape to let him go. Before the making of this Statute the Sheriff u≈øually took Sureties for the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Pri≈øoner, and by this means u≈øed great Extortion and took great Sums of Mony; to prevent which Mi≈øchiefs this Statute was made and ≈øo de≈øigned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the ea≈øe of the Pri≈øoner, the Sheriff being now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to take Security, which he was not obliged to do before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prevent Extortion, and therefore directs that a Bond ≈øhall be taken in ≈øuch manner and with ≈øuch conditions as is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned.</p>
               <p>But the Plaintiff ≈øince the Statute is much in the ≈øame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:172213:96"/> as before, for he is to make the ≈øame Return of <hi>Cepi Corpus:</hi> 'Tis true, he may now let him go upon Bail, but as to the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor he is to have him in Court to an≈øwer his Suit as before, and ≈øhall be amerced if he doth not appear at the Return of the Writ, ≈øo that tho' this Statute be an ea≈øe to the Defendant, yet 'tis a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the Sheriff, who runs a greater hazard ≈øince the making of this Act than before; becau≈øe then he might keep him in pri≈øon till the Debt was ≈øatisfied, but now he is obliged to let him at large upon Bail, from whom he is directed to take a Bond, which he may keep in his own hands to indempnifie him≈øelf: The Court can only amerce him, if the Defendant do not appear at the Return of the Proce≈øs, and 'tis not material to the party whether the Sheriff take one or more Security, that being in his di≈øcretion; ≈øome he mu≈øt take, for otherwi≈øe 'tis directly in oppo≈øition to the Statute; neither is it material to the party whether they are ≈øuch as are ≈øufficient, for if they are not, and the Defendant is thereupon di≈øcharged, this will not amount to an E≈øcape; becau≈øe nothing is done but what is pur≈øuant to the Statute, and therefore he is no otherwi≈øe chargeable than by Amerciaments.</p>
               <p>The Statute was made and intended for the benefit of the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, not of the Creditor, and there might be ≈øome colour for the Action if the Sheriff might Return that he let him to Bail, for then it might have been nece≈ø≈øary to have alledged the ≈øufficiency of them, which might have been traver≈øed; but now he mu≈øt pur≈øue the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the Statute ≈øo far as to take Bail; he is the proper Iudge of the ≈øufficiency, and when the Bail is taken he mu≈øt return a <hi>Cepi Corpus,</hi> ≈øo that he is only to be amerced till he bring in the Body, but an E≈øcape will not lie again≈øt him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They find that the Company was ≈øei≈øed in F√©e of five Me≈ø≈øuages in which were <hi>35</hi> Fire Hearths in the Month of <hi>April, 1673.</hi> And that the Company did never fini≈øh the≈øe Me≈ø≈øuages, and that from the time of the building they ≈øtood all void, and unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by any Tenant or Tenants what≈øoever.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:172213:99"/>
               <p>Then they find that the Collectors were lawfully authori≈øed, and that ≈øuch a day they demanded the Duty for the Fire-Hearths in each of the ≈øaid Me≈ø≈øuages, which they al≈øo demanded of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and which they refu≈øed to pay, and thereupon they took the di≈øtre≈øs and kept it till the Company paid the ≈øaid Duty, and ≈øo make a general Conclu≈øion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Que≈øtion was, whether the Owner of a new Hou≈øe unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited from the time of the building thereof ought to pay this Duty during all that time?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Symp≈øon</hi> argued that they ≈øhall not be chargeable with this Duty; their general Rea≈øon was, becau≈øe no Duty ≈øhould ari≈øe to the King without ≈øome benefit to the Subject.</p>
               <p>And as to that it was ≈øaid, that in this Ca≈øe both the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Crown and the Property of the Subject are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, from which, as from a Root, all the≈øe Impo≈øitions ari≈øe to ≈øu≈øtain the publique Charge. And therefore</p>
               <p>It hath been the way of Iudges in the Interpretations of Statutes, not only to con≈øider the benefit of the Crown, but to regard what is convenient for the Subject.</p>
               <p>There are two Rea≈øons for Impo≈øitions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Such as are Cu≈øtoms, <hi>viz.</hi> Tunnage and Poundage and private Tolls, which come in lieu of other things, and ≈øo are <hi>quid pro quo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Sub≈øidies or Grants from the People, which naturally ari≈øe in ≈øome proportion from a benefit to the Subject.</p>
               <p>And under the la≈øt of the≈øe Rea≈øons falls the pre≈øent Duty given by the Act of <hi>14 Car.</hi> only to proportion the Revenue to the publique Charge of the Crown; and therefore 'tis not to be thought that the Parliament ever intended a Duty to the King where the Subject had no benefit, for <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit;</hi> and how can it be thought that a Duty ≈øhould be paid before the Subject hath any Rent, which is the Mother of the Duty; for if a Man expends <hi>1000 l.</hi> in building, which is all he is worth, and the Hou≈øes ≈øhould happen not to be let, how can he then rai≈øe ≈øuch a Sum as mu≈øt be paid to the King? And 'tis an Objection of no weight to ≈øay, if this Duty mu≈øt not be paid till the Hou≈øes are let, then the Revenue of the King depends upon a Contingency; becau≈øe all Duties which come to the Crown do depend upon ≈øuch.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be con≈øidered is the Act it ≈øelf, and as to that,</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> It mu≈øt be taken as an Act which gives a new Duty to the Crown, and thereupon ≈øuch Con≈øtruction ought to be made that the Subjects E≈øtate be not charged further than the Words will bear; and for that rea≈øon it is to be taken in an ordinary ≈øen≈øe, and not to be ≈øtrained, though it had been in the Ca≈øe of an old Duty; and for that the<note n="*" place="margin">7 Co. 21.</note> Lord <hi>Ander≈øon's Ca≈øe</hi> is a good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>viz.</hi> The Statute of <hi>33 H. 8. cap. 30.</hi> makes <hi>all Mannors (which de≈øcend to any Heir who≈øe Ance≈øtor was indebted to the King by Judgment, Recogni≈øance, Obligation or other Specialty) chargeable for payment of the Debt.</hi> Tenant in Tail is bound in a Recognizance to <hi>S.</hi> who is attainted; then Tenant in Tail dies and his I≈ø≈øue aliens <hi>bona fide,</hi> the King cannot extend the Lands ≈øo ≈øold, becau≈øe the Act ≈øhall not be con≈øtrued to mean all Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizances for the Kings Debts though the Words are general enough; and though 'tis not ≈øaid which way the Debts ≈øhall come to the King, either by Forfeiture, Attainder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they ≈øhall be taken in an ordinary ≈øen≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> ≈øuch debts as were due to the King originally; for which rea≈øon it has been always held where an Act gives any thing to the King and lays a Charge upon the Subject, in ≈øuch Ca≈øe it ought to have a moderate con≈øtruction.</p>
               <p>And that this Duty is a Gift cannot be denied, for 'tis called ≈øo in the very Act, therefore ≈øuch ought the Con≈øtruction to be, and the rather becau≈øe it is more for the Kings Honour it ≈øhould be ≈øo; and both in this Ca≈øe as well as in Con≈øtructions of his Grants the Law hath more regard for his Honour than for his Profit.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> This being ≈øo called, a Duty or Tax by the very Words of the Act, doth in the natural ≈øen≈øe import a proportion out of that in which the Subject hath a benefit; and it will be ≈øcarce found that there hath been a general Tax given to the King where the Subject has rather received a lo≈øs than any profit out of the thing taxed, becau≈øe it would be very hard to pay where a Man cannot receive.</p>
               <p>In the Ca≈øe of Tunnage and Poundage provi≈øion is made that the Party ≈øhall have Allowance if the Goods be lo≈øt by Pyracy, which was mentioned to ≈øhew how unlikely it was that the Parliament ≈øhould intend a Duty where the Subject had a lo≈øs.</p>
               <p>Ever ≈øince the making the Statute of <hi>43 Eliz. cap. 2.</hi> Hou≈øes that lay void and untenanted have neither paid to Church or Poor, which al≈øo ≈øhews how the V≈øage hath be√©n in Ca≈øes almo≈øt of the like nature.</p>
               <p>The next thing con≈øidered were the Clau≈øes in this Act of <hi>14 Car. 2. cap. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:172213:100"/>
                  <hi>1.</hi> The fir≈øt Clau≈øe gives a Duty, <hi>viz. That every Chimny and Stove ≈øhall pay <hi>2 s.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The next Clau≈øe is to bring this Duty into a way of Charge, <hi>viz. That every Owner or Occupier ≈øhall give unto the Con≈øtable an accompt of the number of Hearths in Writing, and the Con≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to tran≈ømit ≈øuch Accompts to the Se≈ø≈øions, there to be enrolled by the Clerk of the Peace, and a Duplicate to be ≈øent into the Exchequer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which it is to be ob≈øerved that where mention is made of bringing this Duty into a Charge, both <hi>Owners</hi> and <hi>Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers</hi> are named, but the <hi>Owner</hi> is not named in any place where the payment of the Duty is mentioned, but the <hi>Occupier</hi> only; ≈øo that from the very intent and rea≈øon of the Act he cannot be chargeable.</p>
               <p>The Accompt thus tran≈ømitted is to charge the Inheritance, and therefore it concerns the Owner to look after the Charge; but for empty Hou≈øes he cannot be charged, becau≈øe the Act takes no notice of them in the Clau≈øe of Payment, but are purpo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted that being laid on the Occupier, and this appears by the Provi≈øo which is ≈øtrongly penned for the Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz. Provided that the Payments and Duties hereby charged ≈øhall be charged only upon the Occupier for the time being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not on the Land-Lord who lett and demi≈øed the ≈øame;</hi> ≈øo that by the Body of the Act every Hou≈øe is charged, which being general might have given ≈øome colour to charge the Owner, but by the Provi≈øo the Payment is re≈øtrained to the Occupier, and if there be no ≈øuch, there ≈øhall be no Payment.</p>
               <p>It was ≈øaid that it cannot be in≈øi≈øted upon that an Owner is an Occupier, becau≈øe the legal acceptance of the Word <hi>Occupation</hi> doth only intend an actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and not a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion in Law, and ≈øuch is the meaning of the Statute by charging the Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier for the time being.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Provi≈øo extends to Ca≈øes where Tenants run away and pay no Rent, (as it certainly doth) becau≈øe there is no Occupier then in being; what difference can there be between that and this Ca≈øe where the Land-Lord in both hath no Rent? for if he ≈øhall not pay where he cannot receive Rent, why ≈øhould he pay where he hath none to receive?</p>
               <p>And that this was the meaning of the Parliament may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear by a Clau≈øe in the Act of <hi>16 Car. 2. cap. 3.</hi> made for collecting this Duty by Officers appointed by the King, which doth not inlarge the former Statutes, and by which 'tis En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, <hi>That if any Occupier ≈øhall leave his Hou≈øe before any of the half yearly Fea≈øts, whereon this Duty is appointed to be paid,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:172213:100"/> that the next Occupier ≈øhall be chargeable with the ≈øame for the ≈øaid half year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Clau≈øe had been altogether vain and of no u≈øe, if empty Hou≈øes had been chargeable with this Duty; for to what purpo≈øe was it to charge a ≈øucceeding Occupier when the Hou≈øe it ≈øelf, though untenanted, was chargeable before?</p>
               <p>In this Act al≈øo, which ≈øupplies the defects of the former, this Duty is made payable unto the Officer upon demand at the Hou≈øe where the ≈øame ≈øhall ari≈øe and grow due, and that in ca≈øe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øal by the ≈øpace of an hour the Officer may di≈øtrein, which ≈øhews a Demand mu≈øt be where there may be a Refu≈øal, and no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øal can be where there is no Occupier.</p>
               <p>There is al≈øo another Clau≈øe which mentions both Owner and Occupier in this Act, and which ≈øaith, <hi>That no Proprietor, Owner or Occupier, ≈øhall be mole≈øted or charged, unle≈øs within two years after the Duty accrewed;</hi> ≈øo that where-ever a charge is laid, or an ea≈øe is given to the Subject, the Word Occupier and ≈øometimes both Occupier and Owner promi≈øcuo≈ølly are u≈øed; but where a payment is to be made, the Owner is never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and if ≈øo, nothing ≈øhall be intended within either of the Statutes, to enlarge this Duty upon the Subject, beyond the Words and plain meaning thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> There is another Point in this Ca≈øe which concerns the King and all the People of <hi>England,</hi> that is, whether the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant here can be charged with a Di≈øtre≈øs (≈øuppo≈øing this Duty is to be paid to the King) before any account of the≈øe Hearths is tran≈ømitted into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> which fir≈øt ought to be done; or otherwi≈øe the con≈øequence will be, that the Officer may demand and take as much as he will at his plea≈øure, and the King may be likewi≈øe prejudiced in his Revenue; for as the Collector may have from the Subject more than he ought, and more than he is empowered to take by the Law, ≈øo he may pay the King le≈øs.</p>
               <p>The Act directs, That an Account ≈øhall be taken by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and examined by the Con≈øtables; then to be tran≈ømitted to the Se≈ø≈øions, there to be enrolled, and from thence ≈øent into the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> now what occa≈øion was there of all this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempnity, if that the King was entituled to a Di≈øtre≈øs upon a bare refu≈øal?</p>
               <p>This being a Rent Charge upon a Mans Inheritance, the King ≈øhall not be entituled to it but by matter of Record; for he cannot take or part with any thing, neither can he have any E≈øtate or Profit rendered him out of another Mans E≈øtate, but by matter of Record; ≈øo that it ≈øeems by the Act that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt is nece≈ø≈øary to be tran≈ømitted into the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:172213:101"/> that the King is not entituled to a Di≈øtre≈øs for this Duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that be actually done, which is not only matter of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Crown, but in ≈øome mea≈øure intitles him to it, becau≈øe there is a Penalty of five pounds laid upon the Officer, who ≈øhall neglect to bring in ≈øuch accompt, which ≈øhews that the Subject ought not to be charged before; for which rea≈øons Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was prayed for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note>But on the other ≈øide it was argued by Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torny General, that empty Hou≈øes ≈øhould pay this Duty: For the Attorny General ≈øaid, that the Words in the Act were ≈øo expre≈øs, that he was of Opinion that the very reading of them would clear the Point in que≈øtion.</p>
               <p>In their Arguments two things were con≈øidered upon the Statute of <hi>14 Car. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Fir≈øt the general Clau≈øe which gives the Duty in the Body of the Act.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The di≈øcharge in the Provi≈øo.</p>
               <p>And if this be in the Body of the Act, and not excepted in the Provi≈øo, then the Duty is to be paid; and as to that it was ≈øaid, that this Duty was given in general Words, by which it appears, that there was a de≈øign and intent to charge empty Hou≈øes, <hi>for every dwelling Hou≈øe, Edifice, or Hou≈øe what≈øoever</hi> is to pay this Duty; and that if every Hou≈øe, why not an empty Hou≈øe?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, a Dwelling Hou≈øe is not a Hou≈øe wherein there <hi>hath</hi> not been an Inhabitant, but wherein ≈øome body <hi>doth</hi> actually live; and if a Man furni≈øhes a Hou≈øe very well, if 'tis not inhabited, it is notwith≈øtanding an empty Hou≈øe, and ≈øuch a Hou≈øe as to ≈øome purpo≈øes in the Law is not a dwelling Hou≈øe; for 'tis not a Man≈øion Hou≈øe, ≈øo as to make it Burglary for the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it open.</p>
               <p>By the ≈øecond Clau≈øe, <hi>Every Owner or Occupier is to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe the Account to be ≈øent into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi>
                  </hi> by which it appears that tho≈øe Words <hi>Owner and Occupier</hi> are not there u≈øed in a different ≈øen≈øe, for if the Occupier were only lyable, the Owner need not look after the ≈øigning the accompt of every Hearth.</p>
               <p>The third Clau≈øe takes notice, That if it ≈øhould happen there be no Occupier, then the Officer may go into the empty Hou≈øe to examine if the account given him be true; now if an account is to be taken of ≈øuch Hou≈øes as are charged by this Act, and an account is directed to be taken of empty Hou≈øes, then ≈øuch empty Hou≈øes mu≈øt be charged; and this ≈øeemed to them to be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:172213:101"/> the intent and meaning of the Parliament, for there being a Return to be made of empty Hou≈øes, if ≈øuch had not been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be charged, they would have directed a Return al≈øo to have been made of the non-inhabitancy.</p>
               <p>And therefore they thought that ≈øomething more than an <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupier</hi> was here meant, for otherwi≈øe the Word <hi>Owner</hi> had not been put in; the meaning of which mu≈øt be that dwelling Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes come within the charge of Occupiers, and empty Hou≈øes within the charge of the Owners.</p>
               <p>Then as to the Provi≈øo, That the Duty hereby ari≈øing ≈øhall be charged only upon the Occupiers and Dwellers of ≈øuch Hou≈øes, their Executors and Admini≈øtrators, that can in no ≈øort extend to di≈øcharge an empty Hou≈øe, becau≈øe 'tis not the ≈øubject matter of the Provi≈øo; for the de≈øign and purpo≈øe of it was not to di≈øcharge the Duty, but to transfer the charge upon the Tenant where the Hou≈øe was inhabited; for if a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction ≈øhould be made, then no Duty ≈øhould be paid at all by the Owner him≈øelf if he ≈øhould live in his own Hou≈øe.</p>
               <p>In the Ca≈øe of a <hi>Modus decimandi</hi> 'tis payable by the Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of the Hou≈øe, and the Landlord is never charged but where there is no Occupier.</p>
               <p>As to the Objection, That 'tis hard to pay a Duty where a Man has no Profit; it was an≈øwered, That the Act took care that Men ≈øhould not ≈øtop up their Chimnies when once made, and that this Duty was paid for many Chimnies which were never u≈øed, and what Profit can a Man have of a Chimny he never u≈øeth? If there had been an Act that ≈øo much ≈øhould be paid for every Window, 'tis all one whether it had been for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or plea≈øure, or whether the Window had been u≈øed or not; and there is as much rea≈øon that a Man ≈øhould pay for Hou≈øes never Inhabited, as for ≈øuch as have been Inhabited and are afterwards without Tenants.</p>
               <p>This Act ought therefore to receive a favourable Con≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Preamble whereof mentions that it was for the encrea≈øing of the Kings Revenue, which is <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> and which is for the Peace and Pro≈øperity of the Nation, and the protection of every ≈øingle per≈øon therein; and though a particular Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience may follow, the Party ought to ≈øubmit. When a Man builds a Hou≈øe, he propo≈øes a Profit, and 'tis not fit the Kings Duty ≈øhould be contingent and depend till he has provided him≈øelf of a Tenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> As to the other Objection that was much relied on, <hi>viz.</hi> where the Act ≈øpeaks of an <hi>Accompt</hi> to be given, it mentions both <hi>Owner</hi> and <hi>Occupier;</hi> but where it directs the Payment of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:172213:102"/> the Duty the Occupier only is named, by which it was inferred that he alone was chargeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> In <hi>16 Car. 2. cap. 3.</hi> Owner, Proprietor and Occupier are u≈øed promi≈øcuou≈øly, wherein it is provided that they ≈øhall not be charged unle≈øs within two years after the Duty accrued; now if the Owner was not chargeable, why is he mentioned there?</p>
               <p>As to the ≈øecond Point, they conceived that the Duty being payeable to the King, he had a remedy by di≈øtre≈øs before the Accompt was certified into the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> for the Return was to inform the King what advantage he maketh of his Revenue, and no Proce≈øs i≈ø≈øued upon it; be≈øides the Act ve≈øts the Duty in him from <hi>Lady</hi>-day <hi>1662.</hi> And by rea≈øon of that he may di≈øtrain. The King hath no benefit by returning of the Account, that being only intended to prevent his being cheated, ≈øo that 'tis not to entitle but to inform him; 'tis only to return a ju≈øt and true account; not but that it may be levied, and the King entitled before; and 'tis no inconvenience to the Subject, if there be no ≈øuch Account returned, for if the Officer di≈øtrain for more Hearths than in truth there are, the Subject has a proper remedy again≈øt him.</p>
               <p>The King ≈øuffers when Returns are not made of ≈øuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as he ought to have for the ≈øupport of his Dignity; and becau≈øe he is lyable to be defrauded in the managing of his Duty, is it rea≈øonable that he ≈øhould lo≈øe all?</p>
               <p>As to what was ≈øaid of the Kings taking by matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; 'tis true, if he dive≈øt an Inheritance, as in ca≈øe of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, it mu≈øt be by Record; but here the very Duty is given to him by the Act it ≈øelf, which makes it a different Ca≈øe.</p>
               <p>If the King ≈øhould be ≈øei≈øed in Fee of a great Wa≈øt, which happens to be improved by his Tenants, and thereby Tythes become due, it may be as well ≈øaid, that he ≈øhall have no Tythes without Record, as to ≈øay he ≈øhall have no Hearth-Mony for Hou≈øes newly erected, whereby his Revenue is increa≈øed.

               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> That one <hi>J.

               <p>It was ≈øaid, That when a Man is ≈øei≈øed of Lands where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are <hi>Mines</hi> open, and others not open; and a Lea≈øe is made of the≈øe Lands in which the Mines are mentioned.<note place="margin">Antea.</note> 'Tis no new Doctrine to ≈øay, that the clo≈øe Mines ≈øhall not pa≈øs; Mens Grants mu≈øt be taken according to u≈øual and common intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and when Words may be ≈øatisfied, they ≈øhall not be ≈øtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farther than they are generally u≈øed, for no violent Con≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øhall be made to prejudice a Mans Inheritance, contrary to the plain meaning of the Words.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, 'tis too late now to que≈øtion the Iuri≈ødiction of the Inferiour Court, after the Party hath admitted it below; he ought fir≈øt to have pleaded to the Iuri≈ødiction, but now is E≈øtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by his own admittance there; and ≈øince Iudgment is given upon it, 'tis not now to be que≈øtioned; but however, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Ca≈øe of an Officer, if it was out of the Iuri≈ødiction he is bound to execute the Proce≈øs of the Court, and ≈øo this is a good excu≈øe for him, <hi>Dyer 61. 10 Co. 77.</hi>

               <p>And as to that, the Chief Iu≈øtice, and <hi>Wyndham</hi> Iu≈øtice were of Opinion, That this was no good ju≈øtification as to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff below; for if the cau≈øe of Action did ari≈øe without the Iuri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, of which he is bound to take notice, the proceedings <hi>quoad</hi> him, are all <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> and he cannot ju≈øtifie the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of any Proce≈øs; ≈øo that if the Tre≈øpa≈øs was done out of the Iuri≈ødiction of the Court, the Defendant below may bring an Action again≈øt the Plaintiff, and is not concluded here by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings there, but may alledge the cau≈øe of Action to ari≈øe out of the Iuri≈ødiction; and as to his being E≈øtopped by admitting of the Iuri≈ødiction below, that cannot be, becau≈øe an admittance cannot give the Court a Iuri≈ødiction where it had none originally, and ≈øo he ≈øaid it was re≈øolved in one <hi>Squib's</hi> Ca≈øe, in a ≈øpecial Verdict.</p>

               <p>He who ≈øues in an Inferior Court is bound at his peril to take notice of the Bounds and Limits of that Iurisdiction; and if the Party after a Verdict below prays a Prohibition, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that the Court had no Iurisdiction, a Prohibition ≈øhall be granted; and 'tis no E≈øtoppel that he did not take advantage of it before, <hi>1 Roll.

               <p>But Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkins</hi> and <hi>Scroggs</hi> were of another Opinion, they agreed that if an Action be brought in an Inferior Court, if it be not ≈øaid to be <hi>infra Jurisdictionem Curiae</hi> they would never pre≈øume it to be ≈øo, but rather to be without, if not alledged to be within the Iurisdiction, and here in the Plea 'tis not ≈øhewn at all; ≈øo that as the Ca≈øe ≈øtands upon the Plea the Proce√©dings are <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> and there is no legal Authority to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them, and by con≈øequence the Officer is no more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed than the Party, becau≈øe al≈øo 'tis in the Ca≈øe of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Iurisdiction: And ≈øo it hath b√©en adjudged upon an E≈øcape brought again≈øt an Officer of an Inferior Court, wherein the Plaintiff declared that he had brought an Action upon a Bond again≈øt <hi>S.</hi> in the Court of <hi>King≈øton,</hi> and that he had Iudgment and Execution, and the Defendant ≈øuffered him to e≈øcape; this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration did not charge the Defendan, becau≈øe the Bond was not alledged to be made <hi>infra Juri≈ødictionem Curiae;</hi> for though ≈øuch an Action is tran≈øitory in its nature, yet the Proceedings in an inferior Court upon it are <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> if it doth not appear to be <hi>infra Juri≈ødictionem, 1 Roll. Abr. 809.</hi> though in the Ca≈øe of a general Iurisdiction it might be otherwi≈øe.</p>
               <p>But here the Rejoynder doth help the Plea; for the Plaintiff having replied that the Tre≈øpa≈øs was committed out of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and the Defendant having rejoyned that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in his Declaration below that the Tre≈øpa≈øs was done within the Iurisdiction, 'tis now all one Plea, and the Plaintiff hath confe≈ø≈øed it by his Demurrer; ≈øo that in regard it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged below and admitted there, 'tis a good Plea both for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and Party, and the Plaintiff cannot now take advantage of it, but is concluded by his former admittance, and it ≈øhall not be enquired now whether true or fal≈øe.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>taliter proce≈ø≈øum fuit</hi> they all held it well enough, and that there was no nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øetting out all the Proceedings here as in a Writ of Error.</p>
               <p>And as to the la≈øt Exception 'tis ≈øaid that the Burrough of <hi>Warwick</hi> is <hi>antiquus Burgus,</hi> and that the Court is held there <hi>≈øecundum con≈øuetudinem,</hi> which is well enough.</p>

               <p>THE Plaintiff was a Tobacconi≈øt and lived near <hi>Guild-Hall, London;</hi> he married the Daughter of the Defendant,<note place="margin">New Trial granted.</note> who was an Alderman in <hi>Hull,</hi> and had <hi>400 l.</hi> Portion with her; after the Marriage the Defendant ≈øpoke merrily before thr√©e Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes, <hi>That if his Son-in-Law would procure him≈øelf to be Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ≈øo that his Daughter might be a Lady, he would then give him 2000 <hi>l.</hi> more, and would pay 1000 <hi>l.</hi> part thereof pre≈øently upon ≈øuch Knighthood, and the other 1000 <hi>l.</hi> within a year after:</hi> (it being intended when the Plaintiff ≈øhould by his Trade get an E≈øtate ≈øufficient to qualifie him for the Dignity of a Knight.)</p>
               <p>The Son-in-Law without acquainting the Defendant did about nine Months afterwards procure him≈øelf to be Knighted, and brought an <hi>A≈ø≈øump≈øit</hi> for the <hi>2000 l.</hi> which was tried before the

               <p>And now Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> moved for a new Tryal upon the <hi>Affidavit</hi> of the Defendant that he had found out material Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes ≈øince the Trial, and that ≈øuch Witne≈ø≈øes, as he had ready at the Trial, could not get into Court; becau≈øe of the great Tumult and Di≈øorder there with a Multitude of People, by rea≈øon whereof his Council could not be heard from the noi≈øe, and when they offered to ≈øpeak were as often hi≈ø≈øed.</p>
               <p>The Chief Iu≈øtice thought it was a hard Verdict, for he was not clearly ≈øatisfied that the Agreement was good, it being only for Words which were ≈øpoken by the Old Man when he had but a weak Memory; and thereupon a new Tryal was granted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Chief Iu≈øtice thought it was fit ≈øo to be.</p>

               <p>The Defendant pleads that all the ≈øix Months he was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner at <hi>Morocco</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and that after his Return he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øted the Defendant; and to this Replication the Defendant demurred.</p>
               <p>And Serjeant <hi>George Strode</hi> maintained the Demurrer.</p>
               <p>The Que≈øtion was, whether the Plaintiff by neglecting to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Grant of the Annuity to the Defendant hath not di≈øpen≈øed with the whole Condition; and he held that it was di≈øpen≈øed withal, and that no Reque≈øt being made the Bond could not be ≈øued at the Common Law, and therefore the Replication was ill.</p>
               <p>'Tis not ≈øo much a disjunctive Condition to do one thing or another, but the la≈øt Clau≈øe is a Penalty to inforce the fir≈øt; for ≈øeeing the Annuity is to be but <hi>20 l. per annum</hi> for a Life, and yet that <hi>300 l.</hi> is to be paid in ca≈øe that be not granted, this proves it to be only a Penalty, becau≈øe Annuities at the highe≈øt value are but at eight years purcha≈øe, whereas this is fift√©en years purcha≈øe, ≈øo that the <hi>300 l.</hi> could never be intended as a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:172213:106"/> Recompence for the Annuity; neither could the Defendant po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly ≈øave the Condition, becau≈øe the ≈øame time is limited both for the Paymenr of the <hi>300 l.</hi> and granting of the Annuity, <hi>viz.</hi> within ≈øix Months; and the Plaintiff hath to the utmo≈øt time to reque≈øt the executing the Grant,<note place="margin">1 Sand. 287.</note> and therefore the other cannot pay the Mony before.</p>
               <p>But taking the Ca≈øe to be that this is a disjunctive Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet ≈øince Conditions are always made in favour of the Obligor, the power of Election even in ≈øuch Ca≈øes is left wholly in him; but according to ≈øuch Con≈øtructions, as would be made for the Plaintiff, the Election is gone from the Defendant,<note place="margin">Wright <hi>and</hi> Bull, Po≈øtea.</note> and left in the Oblig√©e; for if he do not reque≈øt the Annuity, then the <hi>300 l.</hi> is to be paid, and this is directly again≈øt the Rules of disjunctive Conditions; and the Ca≈øe of<note n="*" place="margin">Cor.

                  <hi>Greeningham</hi> and <hi>Ewre</hi> is expre≈øs in Point, where the Condition of a Bond was, that if the Obligor delivered to the Plaintiff thr√©e Bonds by ≈øuch a day, or gave him ≈øuch a Relea≈øe of them, as the Plaintiffs Council ≈øhould advi≈øe, before the ≈øaid day, that then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Defendant pleads nothing as to the delivery of the Bonds, but ≈øaith, that the Plaintiffs Council advi≈øed no Relea≈øe; and upon a Demurrer this was adjudged for the Defendant, becau≈øe in all Obligations with a Penalty the Election is always in the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor; and this being a disjunctive Condition each part is likewi≈øe in his Election; for if the Obligee ≈øhould not tender the Relea≈øe, the other is not bound to deliver the Bonds; and if he ≈øhould tender it, then the Obligor may either deliver the Bonds or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Relea≈øe, which he plea≈øeth, <hi>4 H. 7. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Man enter into Bond with Condition to marry <hi>Jane</hi> by ≈øuch a day, and the Obligee marry her before the day,<note place="margin">1 Roll.

               <p>So a Man covenants to grant ≈øuch an E≈øtate to his Wife or to leave her worth ≈øo much Mony, if ≈øhe ≈øurvive him, if ≈øhe dies before him the Condition is not broken, though he did not make ≈øuch Grant: In the Ca≈øe of <hi>Warren <hi>and</hi> White</hi> it was lately adjudged in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> that where <hi>Warren</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to <hi>Warner,</hi> and <hi>White</hi> became bound with him to pay the Mony before the <hi>25th</hi> day of <hi>December</hi> then next following;

               <p>Which Ca≈øe he agreed to be Law, becau≈øe there the valuation and worth of the Ship and the Mony to be paid was by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of a Stranger, and the Condition being for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Defendant he is to procure the Stranger to make an appointment what Sum ≈øhould be paid, or to deliver the Goods, otherwi≈øe the Bond is forfeited, and he hath expre≈øly agreed to do the one or the other.</p>
               <p>But this is not like the Ca≈øe at the Barr, where 'tis not a Stranger, but the Obligee him≈øelf that mu≈øt procure the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; for 'tis to be advi≈øed by his Council, and to be done at his Co≈øts; and therefore in<note n="*" place="margin">5 Co. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Lamb's Ca≈øe</hi> it was held that if a Man be bound to give ≈øuch a Relea≈øe before ≈øuch a day as the Iudge of the Admiralty ≈øhall direct; there 'tis no Plea to ≈øay that he appointed none, for the Iudge being a Stranger to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">1 Roll.

               </p>
               <p>So that he took it for a Rule in all Ca≈øes, that where the Act of God or of the Oblig√©e di≈øcharges the Obligor from one part of a disjunctive Obligation, that the Law di≈øcharges him of the other; and therefore prayed Iudgment for the Defendant, <hi>Dyer 361.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>Serjeant <hi>Pemberton contra.</hi> It appears that one thing or the other was to be done in this Ca≈øe; for if the Plaintiff demanded and tendred an Annuity, the Defendant was to ≈øeal it; and if he did not tender it, then likewi≈øe the Defendant was to do ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>viz.</hi> to pay <hi>300 l.</hi> So that the Plaintiff was either to have the Annuity or the Mony.</p>
               <p>He agreed that where the Obligor hath the Election, if in ≈øuch Ca≈øe the Oblig√©e ≈øhall wilfully determine it, that the Bond is thereby di≈øcharged.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:172213:107"/>
               <p>But if a Stranger take away the Election, 'tis no di≈øcharge, for in ≈øuch ca≈øe the other part is to be performed.</p>
               <p>In this ca≈øe the Plaintiff hath done no wilful Act to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Defendants Election, but all which is pretended is that he hath not done ≈øomething nece≈ø≈øary to be performed, which is, that he hath not made a reque≈øt.</p>
               <p>But by his omi≈ø≈øion thereof, the Defendants Election is not taken away, for though no reque≈øt was made within the ≈øix Months, yet the Defendant might have prepared a Grant of the Annuity him≈øelf, and have offered it to the Plaintiff, within the ≈øix Months, upon the la≈øt part of the day; and if he had thus ≈øet forth his ca≈øe, and alledged that the Plaintiff made no reque≈øt, nor tendered him a Grant of the Annuity to Seal, this had been a good performance of the Condition, for he had done that which was the ≈øub≈øtance, which, though it was to be done at the Plaintiffs charge, yet the Defendant might have brought an Action for ≈øo much Mony by him laid to the u≈øe of the other; and the Ca≈øes put in the principal Ca≈øe in <hi>Moor 645.</hi> are expre≈øsly for the Plaintiff in this Ca≈øe, where the Iudgment was, That if there be a Statute with a Defeazance, to make ≈øuch Conveyance as the Council of the Conu≈øee ≈øhall direct, the Cogni≈øor mu≈øt prepare the Conveyance, if the other doth not; and there is a Ca≈øe put where a thing was to be done at the Co≈øts of the Plaintiff, yet the Defendant did it at his own Charge, which he recovered of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>North</hi> Chief Iu≈øtice,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> and the whole Court were of Opinion that the Plea was good, becau≈øe the Defendant had the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Election, and the Plantiff not making the reque≈øt within the ≈øix Months, had di≈øpen≈øed with one part of the Condition, and the Law hath di≈øcharged the Defendant of the other part; and they relied upon the Ca≈øe of <hi>Grenningham</hi> and <hi>Ewre,</hi> which they held to be good Law, and an Authority expre≈øs in the very point.</p>
               <p>In this Ca≈øe the Obligee was to do the fir≈øt act, <hi>Viz.</hi> To make the reque≈øt. Where the Condition is ≈øingle <hi>concilium non dedit advi≈øamentum</hi> is a good Plea to di≈øcharge the Defendant; ≈øo here the Condition is but ≈øingle, as to the Defendant; for though it be di≈øjunctive, yet the Plaintiff hath taken away the benefit of Election from the Obligor of doing the one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ≈øhall be excu≈øed from doing the other.</p>
               <p>The Pleading as alledged by the Council of the Plaintiff, would not have been a good performance of the Condition, for if one be bound to Convey as the Council of the other ≈øhall
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:172213:108"/> advi≈øe, and he makes the Conveyance him≈øelf, this is not ≈øuch a Deed as was intended by the Parties, and ≈øo no performance of the Condition.</p>
               <p>But however the Defendant need not plead it, for he is not bound ≈øo to do.</p>
               <p>Here if the Plaintiff had reque≈øted the Sealing of ≈øuch a Grant of an Annuity, even the Defendant had liberty either to execute it, or to pay the <hi>300 l.</hi> and where the Election is on the Obligors part, neither the act or neglect of the Obligee ≈øhall take it away from him; for it would be unrea≈øonable that the Obligee ≈øhould have his choice, either to accept of the Annuity or the <hi>300 l.</hi> when 'tis a known Rule, That all Conditions where there is a Penalty in the Bond, are made in favour and for the benefit of the Obligor, and the <hi>300 l.</hi> in this ca≈øe to be paid upon the refu≈øal of the Defendant to make ≈øuch Grant, is in the nature of a Penalty to enforce him to do it.</p>
               <p>The principal Ca≈øe in <hi>Moor 645.</hi> was agreed to be Law, but the Rule there put was denied, as not adequate to the pre≈øent Ca≈øe, which was, that if by the Act of God, or of the Party, or through default of a Stranger, it becomes impo≈ø≈øible for the Obligor to do one thing in a disjunctive Condition, he is notwith≈øtanding bound to do the other.</p>
               <p>This is true only as to the la≈øt Ca≈øe, but not to the two fir≈øt; and for an Authority<note n="*" place="margin">5 Co</note> 
                  <hi>Laughter's Ca≈øe</hi> was full in the Point, which is, that when a Condition con≈øi≈øts of two parts in the disjunctive, and both are po≈ø≈øible at the time of the Bond made, and afterwards one becomes impo≈ø≈øible by the Act of God, or of the Party, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligor is not bound to perform the other part.</p>
               <p>And Iudgment was given for the Defendant.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> argued that they were all <hi>in aequali gradu,</hi> becau≈øe before the Act of Di≈øtribution the Ordinary had power to compel the Admini≈øtrator to give and allot filial Portions to the Children of the decea≈øed out of his E≈øtate.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:172213:108"/> at the Marriage, ≈øhall not remain to the Survivor, but the u≈øe and occupation of them only during Life, for the Property did belong to the Children.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of <hi>21 H. 8. cap. 5.</hi> the Ordinary is to grant Admini≈øtration to the Widow of the Inte≈øtate, or to the next of his Kin, or to both, as by his di≈øcretion he ≈øhall think good, and in Ca≈øe where divers per≈øons claim the Admini≈øtration as next of Kin, which be in equal degree, the Ordinary may commit Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration to which he plea≈øeth, and his power was not abridged, but rather revived by this late Act, by which 'tis Enacted,<note place="margin">22 &amp; 23 Car. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That ju≈øt and equal di≈øtribution ≈øhall be made among≈øt Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or next of Kin in equal degree or legally repre≈øenting their Stocks <hi>pro ≈øuo cuique jure;</hi>

               <p>'Tis no Objection to ≈øay, that becau≈øe the Law rejects the half Blood as to Inheritances, therefore it will do the ≈øame as to per≈øonal E≈øtates, becau≈øe ≈øuch E≈øtates are not to be determined by the Common but by the Canon or Civil Law, and if ≈øo, the half Blood ≈øhall come in for di≈øtribution, for this Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirms that Law.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>And if he had not power in any Ca≈øe, he could not grant to whom he plea≈øed. But admitting he could, his power is now abridged by this Statute, and he cannot grant but to the Wife and Children or next of Kin in equal degr√©e or legally repre≈øenting their Stocks.</p>
               <p>Now ≈øuch legal repre≈øentation mu≈øt be according to the Rules of the Common, and not of the Civil Law; for if there be two lawful Brothers and a Ba≈øtard <hi>eigne,</hi> and a Que≈øtion ≈øhould ari≈øe concerning the di≈øtribution of an Inte≈øtates E≈øtate, the ≈øub≈øequent Marriage according to the Law in the Spiritual Court would make the latter legitimate, and if ≈øo a legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentative among≈øt them; but this Court will never allow him ≈øo to be.</p>

               <p>They all agreed al≈øo, That the E≈øtate being well limited, <hi>William</hi> ≈øhould take <hi>per formam Doni</hi> as ≈øpecial Heir, for <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Donatoris in charta manife≈øte expre≈ø≈øa ob≈øervetur;</hi> and 'tis apparent <hi>Thomas</hi> intended that <hi>William</hi> ≈øhould have it, or el≈øe the Limitation to his Heirs Males had been needle≈øs.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Defendant pleaded the <hi>Statute of Limitations,</hi> to which the Plaintiff demurred.</p>
               <p>And the que≈øtion was, whether this Action was barely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Contract, or whether it had a Foundation upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Record?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If on the Contract only, then the Statute of 21 <hi>Jacobi cap.</hi> 16. is a good Plea to barr the Plaintiff of his Action, which Enacts <hi>That all Actions of Debt, grounded upon any Lending or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, without Specialty, ≈øhall be brought within ≈øix years next after the Cau≈øe of Action doth accrew;</hi> and in this Ca≈øe nine years had pa≈ø≈øed.</p>
               <p>But if it be grounded upon matter of Record, that is a Specialty, and then the Statute is no barr.</p>
               <p>Serjeant <hi>Barrel</hi> held this to be a Debt upon a Contract, without ≈øpecialty, for when the Sheriff had levied the Mony, the Action cea≈øes again≈øt the Party, and then the Law creates a Contract, and makes him Debtor, as it is in the Ca≈øe of a Tally delivered to a Cu≈øtomer.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, The Iudgment recovered by the Te≈øtator, is now ≈øet forth by the Plaintiff Executor, but that is not the ground but only an inducement to the Action, for the Plaintiff could not have pleaded <hi>nul tiel Record,</hi> ≈øo that 'tis the meer receiving the Mony which charges the Defendant, and not <hi>virtute Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii</hi> upon a fal≈øe return; for upon the receipt of the Mony he is become Debtor, whether the Writ be returned or not, and the Law immediately creates a Contract; and Contracts in Law are as much within the Statute, as Actual Contracts made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parties.</p>

Jones 97.</note>THE Ca≈øe was; <hi>viz.</hi> a Man being in Execution doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pay the Mony to the Mar≈øhal, for which he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øoned, and thereupon was di≈øcharged; and whether he ≈øhould pay it again to the Plaintiff upon a ≈øecond Execution was the Que≈øtion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanders</hi> argued that he ≈øhould not pay it again; he ≈øaid this Ca≈øe was never adjudged, and therefore could produce no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Point to warrant his Opinion, but parallel Ca≈øes there were many.</p>
               <p>As if the Sheriff take Goods in Execution by vertue of a <hi>Fieri Facias,</hi> whether he ≈øells them or not, yet being taken from the party again≈øt whom the Execution was ≈øued, he ≈øhall plead that taking in di≈øcharge of him≈øelf, and ≈øhall not be liable to a ≈øecond Execution, though the Sheriff hath not returned the Writ; and the rea≈øon is becau≈øe the Defendant cannot avoid the Execution, and he would therefore be in a very bad condition, if he was to be charged the ≈øecond time.</p>
               <p>And if the Sheriff ≈øhould die after the Goods are taken in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, his Executors are liable to the Plaintiff to ≈øatisfie the debt, for they have paid <hi>pro quo,</hi> and 'tis in nature of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract rai≈øed by Law.</p>
               <p>By the Words of the <hi>Capias ad ≈øatisfaciend'</hi> it doth appear that the de≈øign of the Writ is to enforce the Payment of the the debt by the Impri≈øonment of the Defendant: The Sheriff thereupon returns that he hath taken the Body, and that the Defendant hath paid the Mony to him, for which rea≈øon he di≈øcharged him; and for this Return he was amerced, not becau≈øe he di≈øcharged the Party, but becau≈øe he had not brought the Mony into the Court; for the Law never intended that a Man ≈øhould be kept in Pri≈øon after he had paid the debt.</p>
               <p>In this Ca≈øe the Defendant can have no remedy to recover it again of the Mar≈øhal, becau≈øe it was not a bare Payment to him, but to pay it over again to the Plaintiff, and likewi≈øe in con≈øideration that he ≈øhould be di≈øcharged from his Impri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If it ≈øhould be objected by the Mar≈øhal that the Plaintiff hath an Action of E≈øcape again≈øt him, and likewi≈øe by the Plaintiff that he did not make the Gaoler his Steward or Bayliff to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Mony.</p>

                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The Gaoler is made his Bayliff to keep the Party in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and it would be very hard that when the Pri≈øoner will lay down his Mony in di≈øcharge of the Debt, that the Gaoler ≈øhould not have full power to di≈øcharge him.</p>
               <p>If he had come in <hi>Michaelmas-Term</hi> after the long Vacation, and informed the Court that he had offered to pay the Execution Mony to the Mar≈øhal, and that he would not take it, and that the Plaintiff could not be found, the Court would have made a Rule to help him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Holt contra.</hi> If the Payment had b√©en good to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff or Mar≈øhal, yet 'tis not pleadable to the ≈øecond Execution becau≈øe 'tis matter in fact.</p>
               <p>That which hath been objected that the Party ≈øhall plead to a ≈øecond Execution, that his Goods were taken by a former <hi>Fieri Facias</hi> cannot be; for no ≈øuch Plea can be good, becau≈øe by that Writ the Sheriff hath expre≈øs Authority to levy the Mony; and the Plea is not Payment to the Sheriff, but that the Mony was levyed by him by virtue of the Writ, which ought to be brought into the Court, and an <hi>Audita Querela</hi> lies again≈øt the Plaintiff, and then the Defendant is to be bailed, <hi>1 Leon. 141.

               <p>If this Action will not lie then the Party has a Wrong done, for which he can have no remedy; for the order for paying of the Fine was made at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> upon which no Writ of Error will lie; and though the Objection that no Action will lie again≈øt a Iudge of Record for what he doth <hi>quatenus</hi> a Iudge, be great, the Rea≈øon of which is, becau≈øe the King him≈øelf is <hi>de jure</hi> to do Iu≈øtice to his Subjects, and becau≈øe he cannot di≈øtribute it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to all per≈øons, he doth therefore delegate his Power to his Iudges, and if they misbehave them≈øelves the King him≈øelf ≈øhall call them to account and no other per≈øon, <hi>12 Co. 24, 25.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that concerns not this Ca≈øe, becau≈øe what was done here was not warranted by the Commi≈ø≈øion, and therefore the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant did not act as a Iudge; and this difference hath be√©n taken and allowed, that in the Ca≈øe of an Officer, if the Court hath Iurisdiction of the Cau≈øe no Action will lie again≈øt him for doing what is contrary to his Duty; but if all the Proce√©dings are <hi>coram non Judice</hi> and ≈øo void, an Action doth lie, <hi>10 Co. 77.</hi>

               <p>And that the Commi≈ø≈øioners here had no power to impo≈øe this Fine, he argued from the very nature of the pretended Offence, which was neither a Crime or in any wi≈øe puni≈øhable, becau≈øe what the Plaintiff did was upon his Oath; and for that rea≈øon it hath

               <p>An Action on the Ca≈øe lies again≈øt a Iu≈øtice of the Peace for refu≈øing to take an Oath of a Robbery committed, <hi>1 Leon. 323.</hi> and yet it was objected that there he was a Iudge, <hi>Quaere, Brook 204.

               <p>The Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> was ≈øei≈øed of the Mannor of <hi>Aldenham</hi> in the County of <hi>Hartford</hi> in Fee, and the Lands in que≈øtion were held of the ≈øaid Lord by Copy of Court Roll, and are parcel of the afore≈øaid Mannor.</p>
               <p>That the Defendant was admitted Tenant, and a Fine of 8 <hi>l.</hi> impo≈øed upon him for ≈øuch admittance payable at three di≈øtinct payments; that the 8 <hi>l.</hi> was per≈øonally demanded of him by the Lord's Steward, and he refu≈øed payment; whereupon the Lord enters and ≈øei≈øes the E≈øtate for a Forfeiture, which he would not have in≈øi≈øted on, but that the ob≈øtinacy of the Defendant made it nece≈ø≈øary for him to a≈ø≈øert his Title and Right.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hollis</hi> his Steward, being ≈øworn gave E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that a Fine of 8 <hi>l.</hi> was ≈øet upon the Defendant when he was admitted, and that the Lands to which he was admitted were u≈øually lett for 7 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> ≈øo that the Fine was but a little more than a years value: That he him≈øelf demanded the 8 <hi>l.</hi> of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant being a Seafaring-man who refu≈øed to pay it. That he knew the Defendant to be the ≈øame per≈øon who was admitted to this Copyhold: That the Demand was made at the Stewards Chamber in <hi>Staple Inn,</hi> and becau≈øe it was payable at three ≈øeveral days, he then demanded of him only 2 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> as a third part of the 8 <hi>l.</hi> and that he did enter upon the 25th day of <hi>November</hi> la≈øt for Non-payment of the ≈øaid 2 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Council for the Defendant in≈øi≈øted that the Steward ought to produce an Authority in Writing given to him by the Lord to make this Demand and Entry upon refu≈øal,<note place="margin">Ex parte Def.</note> for the Lords owning it afterwards will not make a Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>But the Court held clearly that there was no need of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs Authority in Writing,<note place="margin">Curia.</note> and that it was not nece≈ø≈øary for the Steward to make a Precept for the ≈øeizure, but that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary that the Demand ≈øhould be per≈øonal.</p>
               <p>The Rea≈øon why the Defendant refu≈øed to pay this Fine was, becau≈øe he ≈øaid that by a Decree and Survey made of this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Fine to be paid for this Copyhold was ≈øetled, and it was but 3 <hi>l.</hi> and no more.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:172213:121"/>
               <p>And Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> Solicitor General ≈øaid for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, that the Ca≈øe was very penal on his ≈øide, but that he would make it clear that there was no colour for the bringing of this Action either as to the Matter or the Form.</p>
               <p>He ≈øaid that the Mannor of <hi>Aldenham</hi> had not been long in this noble Lord, he came in as Purcha≈øer or a Mortgagee under the Family of the <hi>Harvies</hi> who≈øe Inheritance it was anciently; and there has been ≈øome doubt whil≈øt it was in their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion what Fines were cu≈øtomary to be paid upon De≈øcents and Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but that is now ≈øettled, and the Defendant was in the Ca≈øe of a de≈øcent for which the Fine is not to be arbitrary at the Will of the Lord; but is reduced to a certainty in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Reign by Con≈øent and Agreement between the Lord and Tenants; and that a Survey was then made by vertue of a Commi≈ø≈øion directed to ≈øome Men of Credit and Worth in tho≈øe days, who were impowred to ≈øet forth the quantity of Land and the value thereof, which was done accordingly; and it was then agreed that a year and an halfs value in ca≈øe of a De≈øcent, and two years value in ca≈øe of an Alienation ≈øhould be paid as a Fine to the Lord, and the proportion of the value was then computed by the Commi≈ø≈øioners, and decreed by the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> to be binding to the Lords and Tenants for ever.</p>
               <p>The Que≈øtion now is, how this years value ≈øhall be computed, the Lord would have it according to the improved value; the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will pay according as it was rated in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time by tho≈øe Commi≈ø≈øioners: Now if this Land had decayed in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Tenant had ≈øtill been obliged to pay a Fine according to the valuation of that time; and if ≈øo, it would be very unrea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make him pay for his Indu≈øtry and Improvement of the Land now it is rai≈øed in value, becau≈øe that was done by his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and at his expence; ≈øo that the doubt being what Fine ≈øhall be paid, an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> will not lie, becau≈øe the Matter is doubtful, and the Law gives the Tenant Liberty to conte≈øt it with the Lord and will never let him be under the peril of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture becau≈øe he will not comply with the Lord to give up his Right without Law.</p>
               <p>But the Lord hath another and a more proper remedy, for he may bring an Action of Debt for the Fine thus impo≈øed, which will try the Right; and is not ≈øo penal to the Copyholder, which Point was lately re≈øolved: And that if a Copyholder had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable cau≈øe to induce him to believe that he ought not to pay the Fine demanded, (let the Right be as it would) yet no Ejectment will lie; for it mu≈øt be only in a plain Ca≈øe that the Lord can enter for a Forfeiture.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:172213:121"/>
               <p>For no Man forfeits his E≈øtate, but by a wilful default in him≈øelf, ≈øuch a Forfeiture as is done and pre≈øumed to be committed upon his own knowledge, but want of under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be made a wilful neglect. 'Tis true, the Decree in <hi>Chancery</hi> made here cannot vary the Law, but it may be Evidence of the Fact; for <hi>prima facie</hi> it ≈øhall be intended that ≈øuch values have been paid time out of mind, becau≈øe the Court have ≈øo decreed; but then when the Fine was declared to be certain, a doubt did ari≈øe how the years value ≈øhall be reckoned, which has been ≈øetled al≈øo by another Decree, and from that time all the re≈øpective Lords of this Mannour have taken Fines according to that value which is mentioned in the Survey, and this Lord him≈øelf hath taken Fines in pur≈øuance of the ≈øame, ≈øo that 'tis clear the Fine cannot be Arbitrary; but be it ≈øo or not, 'tis not material to this purpo≈øe, becau≈øe the Tenant hath a good and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable ground to in≈øi≈øt upon the Decree and Survey, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently there is no wilful Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Baron agreed, That if it be a doubt, and the Tenant gives a probable Rea≈øon to make it appear that no more is due, than what he is ready to pay, 'tis no Forfeiture; but the Law in general pre≈øumes that the Fine is incertain, if the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not ≈øhewed; now if the Tenants doubt did ari≈øe upon the equitablene≈øs of the Fine, in ≈øuch ca≈øe if he refu≈øe to pay, 'tis a Forfeiture; but here it was whether it ≈øhall be paid according to the computed or improved value, and therefore he inclined that the Action would not lie.</p>
               <p>The Exemplification of the Decree was offered to be read, which being oppo≈øed, Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> informed the Court that nothing was more u≈øual, than to read a Sentence in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øtical Court, or a Decree in <hi>Chancery</hi> as Evidence of the Fact: It being allowed to be read, the Council for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant took notice that the Commi≈ø≈øion was therein mentioned which was returned into <hi>Chancery,</hi> and burned when the Six Clerks Office was on fire, in the year 1618. but a Duplicate thereof was produced which the Defendant had from the Heir of the <hi>Harveys,</hi> and ≈øo the Survey was praied to be read, which was opop≈øed by Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> for he ≈øaid that it was no Duplicate, the Commi≈ø≈øioners Names being all written with one Hand, and no proof being made that it was a true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of that which was returned; he likewi≈øe ob≈øerved upon the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Decree, that it was an Evidence for the Plaintiff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe if there had been a ≈øetled Rule for payment of the Fines, there had been no occa≈øion to ≈øeek relief in Equity, and that there
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:172213:122"/> was no rea≈øon that the Defendant ≈øhould come into a Court of Law to prove ≈øuch Settlement by a Decree in <hi>Chancery,</hi> for if there be ≈øuch a Decree his Remedy is proper there; be≈øides, the Decree it ≈øelf only mentions the years value, which was to be ≈øetled by the Commi≈ø≈øioners, and which he ≈øaid was never done, ≈øo that the Decree which appointed the Commi≈ø≈øion was not compleated, and therefore being but executory, is of no force even in Equity.</p>
               <p>The Court were doubtful in the matter, and Baron <hi>Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ≈øaid, That no Action of Debt would lie for this Fine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it was neither upon the Contract, nor as <hi>ex qua≈øi contractu:</hi> But as to that Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> an≈øwered, That many Re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions had been made in his time of Ca≈øes, wherein the Old Books were ≈øilent.</p>
               <p>Vpon the whole, the Court thought this to be a proper Ca≈øe for Equity, and ≈øo directed a Iurour to be withdrawn, which was accordingly done.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But this Ca≈øe is quite different from that, becau≈øe there was neither Vill or Pari≈øh named in the Indenture; but here the Indenture was right, for the Lands are mentioned therein to lie in the Pari≈øhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the≈øe Rea≈øons Iudgment was prayed for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>This Ca≈øe was afterwards argued in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, by Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> and <hi>Maynard</hi> for the Plaintiff, who ≈øaid,</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:172213:124"/> and from hence it is, that in real Actions which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øary, Lands ought not to be demanded as lying in a Pari≈øh, but within a Vill, that being the place known to the Civil Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction; and if a Tre≈øpa≈øs which is local be laid at <hi>Dale</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, there being both the Pari≈øh and Vill of <hi>Dale,</hi> the proof of the Tre≈øpa≈øs done in the Pari≈øh is not good, for it mu≈øt be at the Vil.</p>
               <p>They agreed, that in conveying of Lands a Fine or Common Recovery of Lands in a Pari≈øh or <hi>Lieu conus</hi> was good, <hi>2 Cro. 574.</hi> But if there be both a Vill and a Pari≈øh of the ≈øame Name and ≈øeverally bounded, if the Vill be only named without the Pari≈øh, nothing doth pa≈øs, but what is in the Vill, becau≈øe where a place is alledged in Pleading it mu≈øt be of a Vill, <hi>Moor 710.</hi>

               <p>And this was the ancient way of demanding Lands in a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe quod reddat,</hi> becau≈øe of the Notoriety of Vills from whence <hi>Vi≈ønes</hi> do ari≈øe; and becau≈øe the Vill is more particular and of more certainty than a Pari≈øh, and therefore 'tis requi≈øite that the Demandant ≈øhould be very particular in his Demand, that the Tenant may know how to make his defence, and the Sheriff of what to deliver po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>Be≈øides a Vill is more ancient than a Pari≈øh, and Lands have been demanded within them time out of mind, ≈øo that the Demand (when 'tis doubtful of what 'tis made) ≈øhall be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed of that which is mo≈øt ancient; and ≈øuch Con≈øtruction is mo≈øt conformable to the like Ca≈øes, for <hi>Additio probat Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem;</hi> and therefore if Father and Son are both of one Name, and mention is made of one without an addition of <hi>Junior</hi> the Law intends the Father; ≈øo the Vill being more ancient than the Pari≈øh, that ≈øhall be intended if the Pari≈øh is not named.</p>

               <p>As to the finding of the Iury, that doth not help if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery be not full, for they may expound, but they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:172213:125"/> each other; In a <hi>Formedon, nient compri≈øe</hi> in the Record and not what is compri≈øed in the Deed is the Plea. Things upon a Record are open to the View of all People, but a Deed is a Pocket Record, and the per≈øons whom it concerneth cannot come at the ≈øight of it; ≈øo Fines are open and to be ≈øeen by all, and are to be proclaimed, but according to this Interpretation D√©eds ≈øhould be al≈øo proclaimed.</p>
               <p>And there is a manife≈øt difference between things conteined in a Fine and in a D√©ed; for a Fine of a Tenement is not good, but a Deed of a Tenement is well enough, but will not help the Fine; and therefore Men ≈øhould not go out of the Rules of the Law to help a Mi≈øtake: For which Rea≈øons they prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>But the whole Court were of Opinion that the Lands in the Pari≈øhes did well pa≈øs; for as Fines and Recoveries did grow in u≈øe, and are now become Common A≈ø≈øurances, they are to be favoured in the Law: And it hath been a Rule, that even in doubtful things Con≈øtructions ≈øhall be made to ≈øupport a Deed if po≈ø≈øible, <hi>Ut res magis valeat quam pereat, Co.

               <p>By <hi>Rippon</hi> generally the Vill ≈øhall be intended, but <hi>≈øtabitur prae≈øumptio donec probetur in contrarium,</hi> and that is proved by the Deed which ≈øhews where the Lands lye.</p>

               <p>In the Ca≈øe of <hi>Brock <hi>and</hi> Spencer</hi> a Tre≈øpa≈øs was laid in <hi>Hur≈øly,</hi> and it was not ≈øaid whether Vill or Pari≈øh; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleaded that the Lands were held of the Mannor of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in the Pari≈øh of <hi>Hur≈øley, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Venire Facias</hi> was <hi>de Vicineto</hi> only, and not <hi>de Vicineto Parochiae Hur≈øley,</hi> and it was adjudged good, for the Vill and the Pari≈øh ≈øhall be under≈øtood to be the ≈øame.</p>
               <p>And as to this purpo≈øe they were all of Opinion that there was no difference between a Fine and Recovery; 'tis true, the Law originally took notice of a Vill only, becau≈øe the divi≈øion of a County into Pari≈øhes was of Eccle≈øia≈øtical di≈øtribution; but now by proce≈øs of time that di≈øtinction is taken notice of in in Civil Affairs; and the Law hath great regard to the V≈øage and Practice of the People, the Law it ≈øelf being nothing el≈øe but common V≈øage, with which it complies, and alters with the exigency of Affairs; it was but lately that the Cur≈øitors would put the Word <hi>Pari≈øh</hi> into a Writ; for if a Note was delivered
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:172213:125"/> to them of Lands in the Pari≈øh of <hi>Dale,</hi> they u≈øed always to make it of Lands in <hi>Dale,</hi> till the Court ordered them to do otherwi≈øe; ≈øo that though the Common V≈øage was ≈øo formerly 'tis now otherwi≈øe, and the Rea≈øon of things changing the things them≈øelves al≈øo change.</p>
               <p>And if this Recovery ≈øhould not be con≈øtrued to pa≈øs the Lands, the intention of the Parties would faile; 'tis true there is no Authority expre≈øs in the point to guide this Iudgment, nor is there any again≈øt it; but if ≈øuch ≈øhould be, the Opinion of the Court is not to be bound again≈øt apparent Right; and 'tis for the honour of the Law that Men ≈øhould enjoy their Bargains according as they intended; for which Rea≈øons Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given for the Defendant.</p>

               <p>And though in this Ca≈øe the Parliament was adjourned, but in that upon the Statute of <hi>Ed. 6.</hi> it was prorogued, yet the Chief Iu≈øtice ≈øaid, that as to this purpo≈øe there was but little difference between an Adjournment and a Prorogation; for an Adjournment is properly where the Hou≈øe adjourn them≈øelves, and a Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is when the King adjourns them.</p>
               <p>But Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkins</hi> doubted whether the Court ought not to take notice of the Commencement of a general Act, and could have wi≈øhed that there had been no ≈øuch re≈øolution as there was in the Ca≈øe of <hi>Partridge <hi>and</hi> Strange</hi> in <hi>Pl.

               <p>But he held that there was a manife≈øt difference betw√©en an Adjournment and a Prorogation; for an Adjournment makes a Se≈ø≈øion continue; but after a Prorogation all mu≈øt begin <hi>de novo;</hi> and that an Adjournment is not always made by them≈øelves, for the Chancellor hath adjourned the Hou≈øe of P√©ers <hi>ex mandato Domini Regis;</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> adjourned the Hou≈øe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons by Commi≈ø≈øion under the Great Seal.<note place="margin">4 Iu≈øt. 7</note>

                  <hi>H.</hi> being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of ≈øeveral Sheep ≈øells them in a Market to <hi>Al≈øton,</hi> but did not deliver them to the Vend√©e, and afterwards in that very Market they di≈øcharge each other of this Contract, and a new Agre√©ment was made between them, which was, that <hi>Al≈øton</hi> ≈øhould drive the Sheep home and depa≈øture them till ≈øuch a time, and that during that time <hi>H.</hi> would pay him ≈øo much every Week for their Pa≈øture; and if at the end of that time (then agreed between them) <hi>Al≈øton</hi> would pay <hi>H.</hi> ≈øo much for his Sheep (being a price then al≈øo agreed on) that then <hi>Al≈øton</hi> ≈øhould have them.</p>
               <p>Before the time was expired <hi>H.</hi> ≈øells the Sheep to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff <hi>Mires,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Al≈øton</hi> ≈øells them to one <hi>Marwood,</hi> who brought a <hi>Replevin</hi> again≈øt the Plaintiff for taking of the Sheep; and the Officers together with <hi>Solebay</hi> the Defendant (who was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:172213:127"/> Servant to <hi>Marwood</hi>) did by his Order, and in a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Officers drive the Sheep to <hi>Marwood's</hi> Grounds where they left them.</p>
               <p>The Plaintiff demands the Sheep of <hi>Solebay,</hi> and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øal to deliver them, brings this Action again≈øt the Servant, and whether it would lye or not was the Que≈øtion.</p>
               <p>It was urged at the Barr, that the Action would not lie again≈øt the Defendant, becau≈øe he had not the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Goods at the time of the Action brought; for he pre≈øently put them into his Ma≈øters Ground: And it was ≈øaid, if <hi>A.</hi> find Goods and <hi>S.</hi> takes them away before the Action brought <hi>Trover</hi> will not lie again≈øt <hi>A.</hi> but 'tis otherwi≈øe, if he ≈øell them.</p>
               <p>In this Ca≈øe it would have been a Breach of Tru≈øt in the Servant to have delivered the Goods belonging to his Ma≈øter, to another: 'Tis true, if there be a Conver≈øion, though the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion be removed before the Action brought, yet the Action will lie, but that is becau≈øe of the Conver≈øion.</p>
               <p>Many Ca≈øes were put where the Servant is not lyable to an Action for a thing done by the Command of his Ma≈øter; and where a Bayliff, who is but a Servant to the Sheriff, ≈øhall not be charged in a fal≈øe Return made by his Ma≈øter, <hi>Cro. Eliz. 181.</hi>

               <p>The Court before they delivered any Iudgment in this Ca≈øe premi≈øed the≈øe two things: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That 'tis nece≈ø≈øary in <hi>Trover</hi> to prove a Property in the Plaintiff, and a <hi>Trover</hi> and <hi>Conver≈øion</hi> in the Defendant: And it was ≈øaid by Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkins</hi> (but denied by the Chief Iu≈øtice) that though Goods are ≈øold in a Market, yet the property is not changed till the delivery, for which he cited <hi>Keilway 59, 77.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Court held clearly in this Ca≈øe, that the fir≈øt Sale to <hi>Al≈øton</hi> was defeated by the Agreement of the Parties afterwards; for when a Bargain is made, and all the Parties con≈øent to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve it, and other Conditions are propo≈øed, the new Agreement de≈øtroys the former Bargain. And the Chief Iu≈øtice ≈øaid, that if an Hor≈øe was bought in a Market, for which the Vende√© is to pay <hi>10 l.</hi> if the ready Mony be not paid the property is not altered, but the Party may ≈øell him to another.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> This new Agr√©ement to have the Sheep, if <hi>Al≈øton</hi> would pay ≈øuch a Sum of Mony at a future day, will not amount to a Sale, and the new property is changed, and con≈øequently the Sale by <hi>H.</hi> to the Plaintiff before the day is good, and ≈øo the property of the Sheep is in him.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:172213:128"/>
               <p>But by the Opinion of the whole Court the Action would not lie again≈øt the Defendant.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Defendant could be guilty of no Conver≈øion, unle≈øs the driving the Cattle by vertue of the Replevin would make him guilty; but at that time the Sheep were <hi>in cu≈øtodia Legis,</hi> and the Law did then pre≈øerve them ≈øo that no property can be changed, and if ≈øo, then there could be no Conver≈øion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Action will not lie again≈øt the Servant, for it being in Obedience to his Ma≈øter's Command, though he had no Title, yet he ≈øhall be excu≈øed: And this Rule Iu≈øtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> ≈øaid would extend to all Ca≈øes where the Ma≈øter's Command was not to do an apparent Wrong; for if the Ma≈øter's Ca≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon a Title, be it true or not, 'tis enough to excu≈øe the Servant; for otherwi≈øe it would be a mi≈øchievous thing, if the Servant upon all occa≈øions mu≈øt be ≈øatisfied with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter's Title and Right before he obey his Commands; and 'tis very requi≈øite that he ≈øhould be ≈øatisfied if an Action ≈øhould lie again≈øt him for what he doth in Obedience to his Ma≈øter: But it was ≈øaid, the<note n="*" place="margin">Wyne <hi>and</hi> Rider, antea.</note> Servant cannot plead the Command of his Ma≈øter in Barr of a Tre≈øpa≈øs; and it was likewi≈øe ≈øaid, that in this Ca≈øe the driving of the Cattle by the Servant to the Grounds of his Ma≈øter, or a Strangers helping to drive them without being reque≈øted, is ju≈øtifiable.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Becau≈øe what was done by the Defendant was done in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Proce≈øs of the Law, and he might as well ju≈øtifie as the Officer; for if he forbid the Defendant to have a≈ø≈øi≈øted him, yet his a≈ø≈øi≈øting him afterwards would not have made him guilty, becau≈øe done in Execution of the Law.</p>

               <p>And though it hath been ≈øtrongly in≈øi≈øted at the Bar, that the Court ≈øhall intend a conver≈øion unle≈øs the contrary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are to direct a Iury to find the demand and refu≈øal to be a conver≈øion, and the Opinion of <hi>Dodridge <hi>and</hi> Croke,</hi> in <hi>1 Roll.

               </p>
               <p>The Iury found that he was ≈øei≈øed of ≈øuch Lands, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon an Extent goes out to ≈øei≈øe them into the Kings Hands, for payment of 1100 <hi>l.</hi> which he owed to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Al≈øton</hi> the Ter-tenant pleads that <hi>Havers</hi> was indebted to him, and that he was ≈øei≈øed of tho≈øe Lands in 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. which was before the Debt contracted with him, and that he became a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt likewi≈øe before he was indebted to the King, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the≈øe Lands were conveyed to the Defendant by a≈ø≈øignment from the Commi≈ø≈øioners of Bankrupcy, for the Debt due to him from <hi>Havers, ab≈øque hoc</hi> that he was ≈øei≈øed of the≈øe Lands at the time he became indebted to the King.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Attorny General</hi> replies, That he was ≈øei≈øed of the≈øe Lands before the Commi≈ø≈øon of Bankrupcy i≈ø≈øued, and before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Bankrupt, and that at the time of his Sei≈øin he was Receiver, and accountable for the receipt to the King, and being ≈øo ≈øei≈øed in the 20the year of this pre≈øent King, he was found in Arrear 1100 <hi>l.</hi> for the payment whereof he was chargeable by the Statute of the 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Which ≈øubjects all the Lands of a Receiver which he hath or ≈øhall have in him during the time he remains accomptable,</hi> and ≈øo prays that the Kings Hands may not be amoved: To this the Defendant demurred.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Sawyer</hi> for him held, that the Replication was ill both in form and Sub≈øtance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth not appear that the Defendant continued Receiver from the time he was fir≈øt made, as it ought to be, or el≈øe that he was Receiver during his Life; for if a Man is Receiver to the King, and is not indebted but is clear, and ≈øells his Land and cea≈øes to be Receiver, and afterwards is appointed to be Receiver again, and then a Debt is contracted with the King, the former Sale is good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Replication is a departure from the Inqui≈øition, which is the Kings Title, for the Lands of which Inquiry was to be made, were ≈øuch which <hi>Havers</hi> had 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ≈øhews that <hi>Havers</hi> was not then ≈øei≈øed thereof, but makes
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:172213:130"/> a good Title to him≈øelf, by Indenture of Bargain and Sale made to him by the Commi≈ø≈øioners of Bankrupcy, and ≈øo the <hi>Attorny General</hi> cannot come again to ≈øet up a Title prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Defendant, for that is a departure; 'tis enough for the Defendant that he hath avoided the Kings Title, as alledged; and though Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> is not bound to take I≈ø≈øue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Traver≈øe, yet he cannot avoid waveing both the Title of the Defendant and the King, by in≈øi≈øting upon a new matter.</p>
               <p>It was agreed, That the King had two Titles, and might either have brought his Inqui≈øition grounded upon the Debt ≈øtated, or upon the Statute of the 13th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> upon <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> his becoming Receiver; but when he hath determined his Election, by grounding it upon the Debt ≈øtated, he cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards have recour≈øe to the other matter, and bring him to be liable from the time of his being Receiver; as if an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition goes to inquire what Lands the Debtor of the King had ≈øuch a day when he entred into a Bond, if there be an an≈øwer given to that, Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> cannot afterwards ≈øet up a precedent Bond, becau≈øe 'tis a departure, and the Statute it ≈øelf ve≈øts no E≈øtate in the King, but makes the Receivers Lands lyable as if he had entred intred into a Statute Staple.</p>
               <p>The Inqui≈øition therefore ≈øhould have been grounded upon the Statute, and then the Defendant might have pleaded the Act of Indempnity, of which he might have the benefit, but if not he may be let into the Equity of the Statute of the 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. <hi>which gives liberty to Purcha≈øers to have contribution, and to plead ≈øufficient matter if they have any in di≈øcharge of the Debt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ex parte Quer.</note>But on the other ≈øide it was ≈øaid that the Replication was good, for if the Sale was after his being Receiver, though before he became indebted, yet by the Statute of the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Lands are ≈øubject to a Debt contracted afterwards, becau≈øe it hath a Retro≈øpect to the time he was fir≈øt Receiver.</p>

               <p>The Chief Iu≈øtice ≈øaid, That if a real Action be brought again≈øt <hi>A.</hi> who is not Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe,</hi> and a Recovery be had again≈øt him, the Sheriff can turn him out who is in po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion; but if he who is not in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion comes in by Voucher, he is e≈øtopped to ≈øay afterwards that he was not party to the Writ, ≈øo that he who is bound mu≈øt be Tenant or Vouchee, or claim under them.</p>
               <p>Conveyances have been altered, not ≈øo much by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Learned, as by the Ignorance of Vnskilful Men in their Profe≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>The u≈øual Conveyance at Common Law, was by Feoffment, to which Livery and Sei≈øin were nece≈ø≈øary, the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion being given thereby to the Feoffee;<note place="margin">Antea Lord <hi>Salisburies</hi> Ca≈øe.</note> but if there was a Tenant in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and ≈øo Livery could not be made, then the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion was granted, and the particular Tenant always attorned, and upon the ≈øame rea≈øon it was that afterwards a Lea≈øe and Relea≈øe was held a good Conveyance to pa≈øs an E≈øtate, but at that time it was made no que≈øtion but that the Le≈ø≈øee was to be in actual Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion before the Relea≈øe.</p>
               <p>Afterwards V≈øes came to be frequent, and Settlements to V≈øes were very common, by rea≈øon whereof many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies were introduced, to prevent which the Statute of the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>H. 8.</hi> was made, by which the V≈øe was united to the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; for before that Statute V≈øes were to be executed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Equity, but now they are reduced to the Common Law, and are of more certainty, and therefore are to be con≈øtrued according to the Rules of Law.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:172213:132"/>
               <p>At the Common Law when an E≈øtate did not pa≈øs by Feffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Le≈ø≈øor or Vendor made a Lea≈øe for years, and the Le≈ø≈øee actually entred, and then the Le≈ø≈øor granted the Rever≈øion to another, and the Le≈ø≈øee attorned, and this was good.</p>
               <p>Afterwards when an Inheritance was to be granted, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo was a Lea≈øe for years u≈øually made, and the Le≈ø≈øee entred as before, and then the Le≈ø≈øor relea≈øed to him, and this was good.</p>
               <p>But after the Statute of V≈øes, it became an Opinion, That if a Lea≈øe for years was made upon a valuable Con≈øideration, a Relea≈øe might operate upon that without an actual Entry of the Le≈ø≈øee, becau≈øe the Statute did execute the Lea≈øe and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed an V≈øe pre≈øently to the Le≈ø≈øee. Sir <hi>Francis Moor</hi> Serjeant at Law was the fir≈øt who practi≈øed this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Nota.</note>But becau≈øe there were ≈øome Opinions that where Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances may enure two ways, the Common Law ≈øhall be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unle≈øs it appear that the party intended it ≈øhould pa≈øs by the Statute, thereupon the u≈øual cour≈øe was to put the Words <hi>Bargain and Sale</hi> into the Lea≈øe for a Year, to bring it within the Statute, and to alledge that the Lea≈øe was made to the intent and purpo≈øe that by the Statute of V≈øes the Le≈ø≈øee might be capable of a Relea≈øe; but notwith≈øtanding this, Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> was of the Opinion, That this Conveyance by Lea≈øe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea≈øe could never be maintained without the actual Entry of the Le≈ø≈øee.</p>
               <p>This Ca≈øe goes farther than any that ever yet came into Iudgment, for Mony is not mentioned here to be the Con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or any thing which may amount to it, unle≈øs the Pepper Corn, which he held to be a good Con≈øideration.</p>
               <p>The Lea≈øe and Relea≈øe are but in nature of one Deed, and then the intent of the Parties is apparent that it ≈øhould pa≈øs by the Satute, and <hi>eo in≈øtanti</hi> that the Lea≈øe is executed, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation is in force.</p>
               <p>The Ca≈øe put by <hi>Littleton</hi> in <hi>Sect. 459.</hi> is put at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and not upon the Statute; where he ≈øaith, That if a Lea≈øe be made for years, and the Le≈ø≈øor relea≈øeth all his Right to the Le≈ø≈øee before Entry, ≈øuch Relea≈øe is void, becau≈øe the Le≈ø≈øee had only a Right and not the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Comment upon it, calls an <hi>intere≈ø≈øe termini,</hi> and that ≈øuch Relea≈øe ≈øhall not enure to enlarge the E≈øtate without the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, which is very true at the Common Law, but not upon the Statute of V≈øes.</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:172213:132"/>
               <p>And therefore Iudgment was given by the whole Court,<note place="margin">Judgment.</note> that the Word <hi>Grant</hi> in the Lea≈øe will make the Land pa≈øs by way of <hi>U≈øe;</hi> that the Re≈øervation of a Pepper Corn was a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration to rai≈øe an V≈øe to ≈øupport a Common Recovery; that this Lea≈øe being within the Statute of V≈øes, there was no need of an actual Entry to make the Le≈ø≈øee capable of the Relea≈øe; for by vertue of the Statute he ≈øhall be adjudged to be in actual po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and ≈øo a good Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe;</hi> and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given accordingly in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term following.</p>

                  <hi>Parry <hi>and</hi> Banks</hi> was cited, where in the <hi>24th</hi> Year of <hi>H. 8.</hi> a Par≈øonage was appropriated to the Deanary of St. <hi>A≈øaph,</hi> and a Vicaridge endowed, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop di≈ø≈øolved in the <hi>24th</hi> Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Parry</hi> pretending that notwith≈øtanding this Di≈ø≈øolution it was in the Kings Hands by lap≈øe obtained a Pre≈øentation; and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved that after the Statute of Di≈ø≈øolutions, which made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonages Lay Fees, the Ordinary could not di≈ø≈øolve the Vicaridge where the Par≈øonage was in a Temporal Hand, but being in that Ca≈øe in the Hands of the Dean, he might.</p>
               <p>The Rector is to repair the Chancel, becau≈øe of the Profits of the Glebe, which is therefore <hi>Onus reale impo≈øitum rebus &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonis;</hi> and of that Opinion was <hi>Johannes de Atkin,</hi> who wrote <hi>100</hi> years before <hi>Lynwood,</hi> where in <hi>fol. 56.</hi> he ≈øaith, <hi>That if the Chancel was out of repair it affected the Glebe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Con≈øtitution of the Canon Law is ≈øuch will not be denied,<note place="margin">Vaugh. 327.</note> and if ≈øo Canons being allowed, are by u≈øe become parcel of the Common Law, and are as much the Law of the Kingdom as an Act of Parliament, for what is Law doth not <hi>≈øu≈øcipere magis aut minus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several Ca≈øes were put where the Bi≈øhop doth intermeddle with the Profits of a Par≈øonage, as in the Ca≈øe of a Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration upon a Iudgment obtained again≈øt a Spiritual Per≈øon, where a <hi>Fi.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:172213:134"/> making this Statute; 'tis as rea≈øonable ≈øince he hath the ≈øame advantage that he ≈øhould have the ≈øame Charge, and the rather becau≈øe the ≈øaving in the Statute of <hi>31 H. 8. cap. 13.</hi> doth ≈øtill continue the ≈øame Authority the Bi≈øhop had before, though the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion was thereby given to the King.</p>
               <p>The Words of which are, <hi>viz. Saving to all and every per≈øon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ≈øuch Right which they might have had as if the Act had not been made,</hi> which mu≈øt be the Right of the Ordinary and of no other per≈øon.</p>
               <p>An Impropriator pays Synodals and Procurations as well as an Appropriation in the Hands of Eccle≈øia≈øtical Per≈øons, and it would be very inconvenient if a Seque≈øtration ≈øhould not lie which would quicken them more than an Excommunication; and it was ≈øaid, that in <hi>England</hi> there were above <hi>1000</hi> Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations belonging to Corporations aggregate, as Deans and Chapters, which could not be excommunicated; and if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop could not ≈øeque≈øter, then there was no remedy to repair the Chancel: For which Rea≈øons Iudgment was prayed for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>But the whole Court, be≈øides Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkins,</hi> held that the Lay Impropriation was not to be ≈øeque≈øtred for the Repairs of the Chancel: And the Chief Iu≈øtice ≈øaid, that the Repair of the Chancel was an Eccle≈øia≈øtical Cau≈øe, but that the Rectory and Impropriator were Lay, and not to be ≈øeque≈øtred as the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions in the Hands of Eccle≈øia≈øtical Corporations may, which he did agree could not be excommunicated, but the per≈øons who made up ≈øuch Corporation might.</p>
               <p>And as to the Seque≈øtration upon a Iudgment it made nothing for the Matter to entitle the Ordinary to a Seque≈øtration in this Ca≈øe, becau≈øe what he doth in that is in the nature of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Officer; for the Seque≈øtration is like the <hi>Fieri Facias,</hi> and being directed to the Bi≈øhop, he is in that Ca≈øe (if he may be ≈øo called) an Eccle≈øia≈øtical Sheriff, and by virtue thereof may do as the Sheriff doth in other Ca≈øes, that is, he may ≈øei≈øe Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øtical things and ≈øell them, as the Sheriff doth Temporal things upon a <hi>Fieri Facias;</hi> but 'tis to be ob≈øerved that he mu≈øt return <hi>Fieri feci,</hi> and not <hi>Seque≈øtrari feci</hi> upon this Writ.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Saving</hi> in the Statute, that doth not alter the Ca≈øe; for if any Right be thereby ≈øaved, 'tis that of the Par≈øon, for the Pari≈øhioners have no right to ≈øit there; indeed the Vicar may, becau≈øe he comes in under the Par≈øon.</p>
               <p>So that this Ca≈øe is not to be put as at the Common Law, but upon the Statute of Di≈ø≈øolutions, by vertue whereof the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:172213:135"/> Rectory being in the Hands of a Lay Per≈øon is become a Lay Fee, and ≈øo cannot be ≈øubject to a Seque≈øtration; if it ≈øhould, the next ≈øtep would be that the Bi≈øhop would increa≈øe Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges as well in the Ca≈øe of an Impropriation as Appropriation, which would le≈ø≈øen the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of ≈øuch as have purcha≈øed under the Act.</p>
               <p>But Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkins</hi> was of a contrary Opinion; he ≈øaid that it was agreed by all that an Impropriator is chargeable with the Repairs of the Chancel; but the Charge was not per≈øonal but in regard of the profits of the Impropriation, which are originally the Debtor according to the fir≈øt Donation. That the primary Rights of Rectories are the performance of Divine Service and the Repairs of the Chancel, and that the Profits, which are over and above, mu≈øt then go to the Imprpriator, and are to be e≈øteemed then a Lay F√©e; but that tho≈øe Duties are the fir≈øt Rights, and therefore mu≈øt be fir≈øt di≈øcharged.</p>
               <p>That this Right, this duty of Repairing was certain, and therefore ≈øhall not be taken away by Implication, but by expre≈øs Words in the Act, which if wanting ≈øhall remain ≈øtill, and the Parties ≈øhall be compelled to repair under the ≈øame Penalties as before.</p>
               <p>But admitting it ≈øhould be taken away, yet the <hi>≈øaving</hi> in the Act extends to the Right of the Pari≈øhioners, which is not to ≈øit in the Chancel, but to go thither when the Sacraments are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtred, of which they are deprived, when 'tis out of Repair; nor can they have the u≈øe of the Church which properly belongs to them, becau≈øe when the Chancel is out of Repair it not only defaces the Church, but makes it in a ≈øhort time become rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
               <p>He denied that a Seque≈øtration in <hi>Chancery</hi> cannot be pleaded to barr a Tre≈øpa≈øs at the Common Law; for if it be ≈øaid that the <hi>Chancery</hi> have i≈ø≈øued ≈øuch Seque≈øtrations it will be as binding as any other Proce≈øs i≈ø≈øuing according to the Rules of the Common Law.</p>
               <p>And he al≈øo denied the Ca≈øe put by the Chief Iu≈øtice, that the Lands of the Pari≈øhioners might as well be ≈øeque≈øtred for the repair of the Church as tho≈øe of the Impropriator for repair of the Chancel, becau≈øe the Profits of the Rectory might originally be ≈øeque≈øtred, but the Lands of the Pari≈øhioner could not; and ≈øo the Ca≈øes are quite different.</p>

               <p>'Tis probable this Mi≈øtake might ari≈øe from Mr. <hi>Dalton,</hi> who in his Book of the <hi>Office of Sheriffs,</hi> in the Returns of Writs there, hath put down the≈øe feigned Attachers for Examples ≈øake, from whence the Sheriff in this Ca≈øe might inferr that they need not be real per≈øons, as in truth they ought, both upon the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Pone,</hi> and <hi>Di≈øtre≈øs;</hi> and he cited a Ca≈øe lately adjudged, where the like Return was made upon the Grand Cape, and the Iudgment ≈øet a≈øide; and of this Opinion was the whole Court, and ≈øaid, Where the Proce≈øs is ≈øo fatal, the Party ought to

               <p>But on the other ≈øide it was objected, that leaving due notice upon the Summons was as much as was required, for the other Writs are only to give the Defendant time to plead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not nece≈ø≈øary that notice ≈øhould be given upon every one of the Writs, for if once ≈øerved 'tis enough, <hi>11 H. 6. 3, 4. 36 H. 6. 23. 8 H. 6. 8.

               <p>In <hi>2 R. 2. 18.</hi> A Retainer was pleaded ≈øpecially by an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtrator, which is no more than <hi>Plene Admini≈øtravit,</hi> yet no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer; but the Book ≈øaith that the Court ought to be moved.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Plea is good as to the matter of it; for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant claims the ≈øame Common by his Grant which had been u≈øed time immemorial, and alledges it to be of all Common u≈øed with the Premi≈ø≈øes, and this was a Common ≈øo u≈øed.</p>
               <p>In Tre≈øpa≈øs the Defendant ju≈øtified that <hi>Godfrey</hi> was ≈øei≈øed in Fee of a Hou≈øe, and of <hi>20</hi> Acres of Land, and that he and all tho≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had Common in the place where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the ≈øaid Me≈ø≈øuage belonging; and that he made a Feoffment to <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhaw</hi> of the ≈øame, who made a Lea≈øe thereof to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, with all Profits and Commodities thereunto belonging, <hi>vel occupat vel u≈øitat cum praedicto Me≈øuagio:</hi> It was adjudged that though the Common was gone and extinct in the Hands of the Feoffor by the unity of the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, yet tho≈øe Words were a good Grant of a New Common for the time granted in the Lea≈øe, and that it was <hi>qua≈øi</hi> a Common in the Hands of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> the Feoffor, <hi>Cro. Eliz. 570. Godfrey <hi>ver≈øus</hi> Eyre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though it hath been objected, That this Plea is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally pleaded, becau≈øe it ought to have been direct in alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Grant; whereas it was only argumentative, and brought in by a ≈øide Wind, he ≈øaid, That as bad as it was, 'twas drawn by that Serjeant who argued again≈øt him, and who did very well know that the Averment of ≈øufficiency of Common was needle≈øs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Curia.</note>The Court were all of Opinion, That though the Plea did amount to the general I≈ø≈øue, yet for that rea≈øon alone the Plaintiff had no cau≈øe of Demurrer; for the Defendant may
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:172213:144"/> well di≈øclo≈øe the matter of Law in Pleading, which is a much cheaper way than to have a Special Verdict, and that this is on the ≈øame rea≈øon of giving of colour; but if the matter by which the Defendant ju≈øtifies, be all matter of Fact and proper for the Tryal of a Iury, then the Dfendant ought to plead the General I≈ø≈øue.</p>
               <p>And as to the Matter of the Plea, the Chief Iu≈øtice and <hi>Wyndham</hi> Iu≈øtice held it to be good; for the Common which was pleaded was a Common by Grant and not argumentatively plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if the Defendant had pleaded an expre≈øs Grant of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in tho≈øe two places, and the Plaintiff had demanded Oyer of the Deed, it would have appeared that there was no ≈øuch Deed, and this had been a good cau≈øe of Demurrer.</p>
               <p>If this Plea ≈øhould not be good it would be very mi≈øchievous to the Defendant; for there being a perpetual Vnity, as to the Freehold there can be no Pre≈øcription to the Common; but there being a con≈øtant enjoyment thereof by the Tenants, and ≈øo a perpetual V≈øage and a Grant made referring to that V≈øage, 'tis well enough: And ≈øince, whil≈øt the Lands were in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Lord, the Commoners could not complain of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; why ≈øhould they, if he grant the Premi≈ø≈øes, the Grante√© being <hi>in loco, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Ca≈øe of the King a Grant of <hi>tot &amp; talia Libertates &amp; Privilegia quot &amp; qualia</hi> the Abbot lately had,<note place="margin">9 Co. 23. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>de Strata Marcella.</hi>
                  </note> was held good by ≈øuch general Words: Here the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> granted to the Defendant that which the Le≈ø≈ø√©es had before, <hi>viz.</hi> that Common which the Tenants had time out of mind; and it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but that the Tenants had a Right; for as a <hi>Tort</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pre≈øumed to be from time immemorial, ≈øo neither ≈øhall it be intended that the Lord gave only a Licence, and permitted his Tenants to enjoy this Common.</p>
               <p>But Iu≈øtice <hi>Atkins</hi> was of Opinion that the Plea was not good; he ≈øaid, he knew not by what Name to call this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; for it was no more than a Permi≈ø≈øion from the Lord, that the Tenants might put their Cattle into his Freehold, or a Connivance at them for ≈øo doing; and if it be taken as a new Grant, then nothing can pa≈øs, but the Surplus; for the Lord cannot derogate from his former Grant, and the new Grantee ≈øhall not put in an equal proportion with him who hath the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription; for if he may, then ≈øuch Pre≈øcription would be quite de≈øtroyed by ≈øuch <hi>pui≈øne</hi> Grant; for as the Lord might grant to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:172213:145"/> one, ≈øo he might to twenty, and then there would not be ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Common left for him, who pre≈øcribes to the Right: So that he conceived that the Defendant had no Right of Common, or if he had any, it would not be till after the Right of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff was ≈øerved; and he ≈øaid that V≈øage ≈øhall not intend a Right, but it may be an Evidence of it upon a Tryal.</p>
               <p>But if there had been an V≈øage 'tis now lo≈øt by the Vnity of the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and ≈øhall not be revived by the new Grant, like the Ca≈øe of <hi>Ma≈ø≈øam <hi>and</hi> Hunter;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Yelv. 189.</note> there was a Copyholder of a Me≈ø≈øuage and two Acres in Fe√©, which the Lord afterwards granted and confirmed to him in Fee <hi>cum pertinentiis,</hi> it was adjudged that though the Tenant by V≈øage had a Right to have Common in the Lord's Wa≈øt, yet by this new Grant and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation that Right was gone (the Copyhold being thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed;) for the Common being by V≈øage and now lo≈øt, the≈øe Words <hi>cum pertinentiis</hi> in the new Grant will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it.</p>

                     <hi>London</hi>) ≈øhall be heard by two or more of the next Ju≈øtices of Peace, and in ca≈øe of their neglect or refu≈øal by the ≈øpace of 14 days after complaint made, then the Sub-Commi≈ø≈øioners of the Exci≈øe are to determine the ≈øame, from whom no Appeal doth lye to the Ju≈øtices of the Peace at their next Se≈ø≈øions, which Commi≈ø≈øioners of Exci≈øe, Ju≈øtices of the Peace and Sub-Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioners among≈øt other things are inabled by the ≈øaid Act, to I≈ø≈øue out Warrants under their Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to levie the Forfeitures,</hi> and ≈øo ju≈øtified the Entry under a Warrant from the Sub-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners, three Iu≈øtices having refu≈øed to hear and determine this Offence.</p>
               <p>To this Plea the Plaintiffs demurred, and had Iudgment in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and a Writ of Inquiry of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages was Executed, and <hi>750 l.</hi> Damages given; and it was alledged that the Defendant could not move to ≈øet a≈øide the Iudgment in that Term it was given, becau≈øe the Writ of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was executed the la≈øt day of the Term, and the Court did immediatly ri≈øe; and that he could not move the next Term, becau≈øe the Iudgment was given the Term before the Writ of Error was brought.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Attorny General</hi> therefore ≈øaid that this was a hard Ca≈øe, and de≈øired a Note of the Exceptions to the Plea, which he would endeavour to maintain, which Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> gave him, and then he de≈øired time to an≈øwer them.</p>
               <p>The Exception to the Plea upon which the Iudgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> The Act giveth no power to the Sub-Commi≈ø≈øioners to hear and determine the Offences, and ≈øo to i≈ø≈øue out Warrants for the Forfeitures, but where the Iu≈øtices or any two of them refu≈øe: And though it was ≈øaid by the Defendant that three refu≈øed, yet it was not ≈øaid that two did refu≈øe; for there is a great difference between the allegation of a thing in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative and in the Negative; for if I affirm that <hi>A.

C.</hi> did not ≈øuch a thing, there I mu≈øt add <hi>nec eorum aliquis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if an Action be brought again≈øt ≈øeveral Men, and a <hi>Nolle pro≈øequi</hi> is entred as to one, and a Writ of Enquiry awarded again≈øt the re≈øt, which recites, That the Plaintiff did by Bill implead (naming tho≈øe only again≈øt whom the Inquiry was awarded, and leaves out him who got the <hi>Nolle pro≈øequi</hi>) this is a variance, for it ≈øhould have been brought again≈øt them all.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:172213:148"/>
               <p>'Tis true, where a Iudgment is recited 'tis enough to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tho≈øe only again≈øt whom it is had, but the Declaration mu≈øt be again≈øt all; ≈øo in a Writ of Error if one is dead he mu≈øt be named; and ≈øo the Iu≈øtices ought all to be named in this Ca≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the three next Iu≈øtices did not hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this Offence, <hi>nec eorum aliquis.</hi>

               <p>So that the Point was,<note place="margin">Cro. Car. 205. 2 Sid. 151. 1 Roll.

               <p>It was ≈øaid that in ≈øome Ca≈øes a Surrender into the Hands of a Di≈ø≈øei≈øor was good, that is, when the Surrender is made to him to the u≈øe of another and his Heirs, and he admits him, there the per≈øon admitted claims not under the Lord, but under the Copyholder, who made the Surrender;<note place="margin">1 In≈øt. 59. b.</note> for nothing pa≈ø≈øes to the Lord, but only to ≈øerve the Limitation of the V≈øe, 1 <hi>Rol.

               <p>But in this Ca≈øe the Grant√©e mu≈øt claim from the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and not from the Copyholder, becau≈øe he had but an E≈øtate for his own Life, with which he wholly departed when he made the Surrender to the u≈øe of the Di≈ø≈øei≈øor him≈øelf.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Trinity-Term</hi> following this Ca≈øe was argued by Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> on the other ≈øide.</p>
               <p>There are two ≈øorts of Surrenders of a Copyhold.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Proper.</item>
                  <item>2. Formal and Ceremonious.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If a Surrender be to the Lord to the u≈øe of another, this is no proper Surrender; for no E≈øtate pa≈ø≈øeth to the Lord he being only the In≈øtrument to convey it to the Surrendree, and this is but nominal.</p>
               <p>But here the Surrender was to the u≈øe of the Lord him≈øelf, which is a proper Surrender, and in ≈øuch Ca≈øe 'tis nece≈ø≈øary that the Lord have a Rever≈øion, for one E≈øtate is to be turned into the other, and there mu≈øt be a continuing of E≈øtates.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Dominus pro tempore,</hi> who is a Di≈ø≈øei≈øor hath no ≈øuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate: <hi>Executor de ≈øon tort</hi> ≈øhall ≈øue, but he cannot retain.</p>

               <p>If therefore he is not capable to take a Surrender to him≈øelf, unle≈øs he hath ≈øuch an E≈øtate, then here is no Di≈ø≈øei≈øin of the Copyhold, 'tis only of the Mannor; and then no greater Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt pa≈ø≈øeth to the Di≈ø≈øei≈øor than to a Stranger, whil≈øt the true Lord had been in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, for ≈øo he is <hi>quoad</hi> this Copyhold if he was not di≈ø≈øei≈øed of it; for if the Copyholder had the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion there could be then no Di≈ø≈øei≈øin; if he was out of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion then he had nothing but a Right, and that cannot be ≈øurrendred, for it mu≈øt be an E≈øtate; as if a Le≈ø≈øee for years keep po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, 'tis the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Lord, and the Law is the ≈øame in ca≈øe of a Copyhold, 2 <hi>Co.

               <p>So here the Fee de≈øcends to <hi>Benjamin Wharton</hi> in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and he dying without I≈ø≈øue and within Age, the Land ≈øhall then de≈øcend to his Si≈øter and Heir.</p>
               <p>The like Iudgment was given in the Ca≈øe of <hi>Taylor <hi>and</hi> Wharton</hi> about <hi>12</hi> years ≈øince; and in <hi>Dyer 124. a.</hi> A Devi≈øe to his Wife till his Son ≈øhall be of the Age of <hi>24</hi> years, then to the Son in Fee; and if he die before <hi>24</hi> years without I≈ø≈øue, then to the Wife for Life, the Remainder to <hi>A. &amp;c.</hi> The Te≈øtator dyed,<note place="margin">2 Leon. 11. pl. 16.

               <p>So here a Fe√© ve≈øted in <hi>Benjamin</hi> pre≈øently, and he being dead within Age <hi>Mary</hi> may take as Heir; however when ≈øhe is of Age ≈øhe ≈øhall take as Heir of the Body of <hi>Robert</hi> by way of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Devi≈øe ari≈øing out of the E≈øtate of the Devi≈øor,<note place="margin">Stiles 240.

               <p>In this Ca≈øe <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had a Term till <hi>Benjamin Wharton</hi> be of Age, for ≈øhe is Executrix; ≈øhe was likewi≈øe Heir at Law to the Devi≈øor, and this Land had gone to her, had it not b√©en for this Will; ≈øo that 'tis plain the Te≈øtator never intended that a Fee-≈øimple ≈øhould ve≈øt in her, but ≈øomewhere el≈øe; for he could never intend the De≈øcent of the Inheritance to that per≈øon to whom he had devi≈øed the Term.</p>
               <p>It has be√©n argued, that <hi>Mary</hi> is Heir at Law to <hi>Benjamin</hi> as well as Heir of the Body of <hi>Robert,</hi> and ≈øo if ≈øhe can take either way 'tis good; but to make her Heir to <hi>Benjamin</hi> 'tis nece≈ø≈øary that the E≈øtate ve≈øt in him before he comes to <hi>21</hi> years; and for that <hi>Bora≈øton's Ca≈øe</hi> was much relyed on, which was al≈øo ≈øaid not to differ from this at the Barr; that an E≈øtate pa≈ø≈øes to <hi>Benjamin Wharton in prae≈øenti,</hi> and that there was no Incapacity for <hi>Mary</hi> to take by way of Executory Devi≈øe, as was urged on the other ≈øide, and therefore why ≈øhould ≈øhe not take by way of Executory Devi≈øe as Heir of the Body of her Father, or at lea≈øt, as Heir of <hi>Benjamin</hi> her Brother?</p>
               <p>An Executory Devi≈øe needs no particular E≈øtate to ≈øupport it, for it ≈øhall de≈øcend to the Heir till the Contingency happen; 'tis not like a Remainder at the Common Law, which mu≈øt ve≈øt <hi>eo in≈øtanti</hi> that the particular E≈øtate determines; but the Learning of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutory Devi≈øes ≈øtands upon the Rea≈øons of the old Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the intent of the Devi≈øor is to be ob≈øerved: For when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Will that he intends not the Devi≈øee to take but in <hi>futuro,</hi> and no di≈øpo≈øition being made thereof in the mean time, it ≈øhall then de≈øcend to the Heir till the Contingency happen; but if the intent be that he ≈øhall take <hi>in prae≈øenti,</hi> and there is no incapacity in him to do it, he ≈øhall not take <hi>in futuro</hi> by an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory Devi≈øe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Read</hi> was made High Sheriff of <hi>Hartford≈øhire, 12 No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb. 25 Car. 2.</hi> and being ≈øtill under the Sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, he took upon him the Office and executed it for <hi>3 Months, viz.</hi> to the <hi>12th</hi> day of <hi>February</hi> afterwards, and then refu≈øed to ≈øerve any longer; the Iudges came ≈øoon after to keep the A≈ø≈øi≈øes for that County, but there was no Sheriff there to attend them, and the rea≈øon was, becau≈øe if he had executed the Office without taking the Oaths (the time being now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, wherein he ought to have taken the ≈øame,) then he had ≈øubjected him≈øelf to the forfeiture of <hi>500 l.</hi> and he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament becau≈øe he was Excommunicated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øuppo≈øed that after the <hi>3 Months</hi> he was <hi>ip≈øo facto</hi> di≈øcharged by the afore≈øaid Statute; and whether upon all this matter the Defendant be guilty was the Que≈øtion.</p>

                  <hi>Ward</hi> and Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> the Attorny General argued that the Defendant was Guilty.</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> The Oath and Sacrament are nece≈ø≈øary qualifications for all Sheriffs, becau≈øe the Act appoints the≈øe things to be done, and the Penalty therein extends to tho≈øe who execute any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice after the three Months, without doing the ≈øame, but not to ≈øuch who neglect to qualifie them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>And though it may be objected, that the Act gives no Penalty for not taking of the Oath, it only enjoyns it to be done, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Information is in≈øufficient, for there is no Offence at all of which the Common Law doth take notice; and though the Con≈øequences of the thing done may be bad, yet no Man ≈øhall be puni≈øhed for that, becau≈øe tho≈øe only aggravate the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if any; neither is this Information true, for it ≈øaith he refu≈øed <hi>ab≈øque rationabili cau≈øa,</hi> but here was a rea≈øonable cau≈øe: And though it may be objected, that it was only <hi>impotentia volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis;</hi> and that every Subject being disabled, is to remove that di≈øability to ≈øerve the King, this was denied; for a Man who is a Pri≈øoner for Debt is not bound or compellable to be She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, neither is a Man bound to purcha≈øe Lands to qualifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to be either a Coroner or Iu≈øtice of the Peace.

               <p>The intent of the Statute is, That if per≈øons will not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie them≈øelves, they ≈øhall not execute any Office, and it was made to keep Roman Catholicks out of Places, but not to force them to accept of Offices of Tru≈øt in the Government; and it de≈øigns no puni≈øhment for quitting, but for executing of a place contrary to the Law; but if this be an Offence, this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not lie; and for that</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> It was argued, That if a thing be either commanded or forbidden by a Statute, the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion in either Ca≈øe is an Offence puni≈øhable by Information;<note place="margin">25 H 6. pl. 9. b. 7 H. 4. 5.</note> but when an Act doth not generally command a thing, but only <hi>≈øub modo,</hi> the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending is puni≈øhable no otherwi≈øe than de≈øigned by that Law; as where the Statute of <hi>18 H. 6. cap. 11.</hi> prohibits any Man from being a Iu≈øtice of the Peace, unle≈øs he have <hi>40 l.

               <p>And the Objection of <hi>impotentia voluntatis</hi> is not material to this purpo≈øe, becau≈øe Symony, buying of Offices, not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribing the <hi>39</hi> Articles, according to the Statute of the Queen; the≈øe are all voluntary Acts, yet no Information lies again≈øt ≈øuch Offenders, becau≈øe the Statutes execute the puni≈øhment.</p>
               <p>The intent of the Parliament is here declared, the di≈øability of the per≈øon makes the Office void; void to all intents, for the Right of Infants or Men in Pri≈øon is not ≈øaved; ≈øo that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to be an Offence, if the Duty be not performed; yet if ≈øuch a qualification be requi≈øit to make a Man to act in ≈øuch an Office, or perform ≈øuch a Duty, if that qualification be wanting, the Party is only puni≈øhable by the lo≈øs of the Office.</p>
               <p>The Act doth not di≈øtingui≈øh between Offices of Tru≈øt and Profit: And as to the other Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis in the power of the Defendant to qualifie him≈øelf, the ≈øame might as well be objected again≈øt all the Popi≈øh Recu≈øants, upon the Statute of <hi>3 Jac.</hi> and if a Statute doth di≈øable per≈øons or abridge the King of their Services, there is no injury done, becau≈øe the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf is party to the Act; but if mi≈øchiefs were never ≈øo great, ≈øince they are introduced by a Law, they cannot be avoided till that Law is changed.</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi> But admitting the Information to be good, and that this is an Offence for which it will lie, yet the Excommunication is a

               <p>The Defendant is only argued into a Guilt, for the Iury have not found any; they do not ≈øay, that it was in his power to yield Obedience, or that he might have enabled him≈øelf; they only find his incapacity, and though it was a voluntary Act, which was the cau≈øe of his di≈øability, yet in ≈øuch Ca≈øes the Law doth not look to Cau≈øes ≈øo remote.

               <p>But the Court were all of Opinion, that this Information would lye, and that the Defendant was puni≈øhable for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the di≈øability, it being in his power to get him≈øelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved from the Excommunication: And ≈øo Iudgment was given again≈øt him, and a Writ of Error brought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pemberton</hi> and <hi>Maynard</hi> Serjeants argued for the Title of the Plaintiff (who was Heir at Law) That if a Devi≈øe be to <hi>S.</hi> and his Heirs, if <hi>S.</hi> dye living the Devi≈øor, the Heir ≈øhall take nothing, becau≈øe no E≈øtate ve≈øted in his Ance≈øtor; ≈øo if a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øe be to the Heirs of <hi>S.</hi> after his decea≈øe, the Heir ≈øhall take by Purcha≈øe, for he cannot take as Heir for the Rea≈øon afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid.</p>
               <p>By the death of <hi>Robert</hi> the Son, the Devi≈øe to him and his Heirs was void, and the annexing a Codicile and Republication of the Will cannot make that good which was void before; if it cannot make it good, then the Heir cannot take by Purcha≈øe, and by de≈øcent he cannot take, for his Ance≈øtor had no E≈øtate, and therefore he ≈øhall have none.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That the ≈øaid <hi>Prior</hi> 25 <hi>H.</hi> 1. granted the ≈øaid Mannor and Tythes to <hi>William Fitzherbert</hi> and his Heirs, rendring Rent: That the ≈øaid <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> did Enter and was ≈øei≈øed, and held it di≈øcharged of Tythes; that his Heirs afterwards granted two Hides of Land, part of the ≈øaid Mannor, to <hi>S.</hi> with the Tythes, at 5 <hi>s.</hi> Rent; and ≈øo draws down a Title by De≈øcent for 300 years to <hi>F.</hi> who being ≈øei≈øed devi≈øed the ≈øame to <hi>Dorothy James,</hi> (under whom the Plaintiff in the Prohibition claimed) and then concludes, That <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> and all tho≈øe who≈øe E≈øtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did pay the ≈øaid Rent to the ≈øaid <hi>Prior,</hi> which ≈øince the Di≈ø≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was paid to the <hi>King</hi> and his A≈ø≈øigns, in di≈øcharge of all Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Defendant having craved Oyer of the Deed demurred to the Sugge≈øtion; and Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff in the <hi>Common-Pleas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was now ≈øaid for the Plaintiff in the Errors, That it doth not appear by the Pleadings whether the Plaintiff in the Prohibition would di≈øcharge him≈øelf by a <hi>Prae≈øcription in non decimando,</hi> or in <hi>modo decimandi;</hi> for the Grant from the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> being the foundation of his Title, he could not thereby be di≈øcharged, becau≈øe a Deed before Memory cannot be pleaded, unle≈øs it hath been allowed in a Court of Eyre, or ≈øome Court of Record ≈øince Memory; and this Deed being dated in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>I.</hi> which was 65 years before the time of Memory by the Common Law, that beginning in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>I.</hi> whatever is before that time cannot be tried by Law; if it had been allowed in Eyre, or in ≈øome of the Courts of Record, it may be pleaded, but no u≈øage in <hi>pais</hi> can confirm it.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:172213:166"/>
               <p>But ≈øuppo≈øing the Deed to be good, the Plaintiff hath alledged a Grant of a portion of Tythes which he cannot have; for at the Common Law a Lay-man was not capable of Tythes in <hi>prender,</hi> for no one had capacity to take or receive them,<note place="margin">Jones 369. 2 Co. 49.</note> ≈øave only ≈øpiritual per≈øons, for which Rea≈øons a Lay-man could not pre≈øcribe <hi>in non decimando,</hi> but in <hi>modo decimandi</hi> he might, becau≈øe there is ≈øtill an annual recompence in ≈øatisfaction thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis not alledged, that the place where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was parcel of the Deme≈øus of the Mannor, therefore for what appears it might have been always in Tenancy; and though a Pre≈øcription to a <hi>modus</hi> by the Lord, for him≈øelf and all his Tenants is good,<note place="margin">Cro. Eliz. 599.</note> becau≈øe it might have a lawful beginning, for the Lands at fir≈øt might be all in his Hands before it was a Mannor, and ≈øo much paid for the Tythes thereof, yet ≈øuch a Pre≈øcription by a Tenant is not good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He hath alledged payment to the <hi>Prior,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>King,</hi> and ≈øo would infer a <hi>Modus,</hi> to which he hath not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitively pre≈øcribed, but by an old Deed upon payment of 5 <hi>s. to all tho≈øe who≈øe E≈øtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> And this will not do, for unle≈øs the <hi>Modus</hi> doth go to the per≈øon who by Law ought to have Tythes, or unle≈øs it be for his benefit, 'tis not good; as where it was alledged that he ought to be di≈øcharged, becau≈øe time out of memory he employed all the profits of the Land for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of the Body of the Church, and to find nece≈ø≈øaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this was not a good <hi>Modus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Roll. Abr. 649 placito 8.</note> becau≈øe 'tis no recompence for the Par≈øon.</p>
               <p>But it was ≈øaid by <hi>Saunders</hi> for the Plaintiff in the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, That by the Sugge≈øtion there was a good Title alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be di≈øcharged of Tythes; for 'tis ≈øet forth that the <hi>Prior</hi> had a portion of Tythes, and the Lands <hi>≈øimul &amp; ≈øemel,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Corporation they might pre≈øcribe for Tythes in <hi>prender,</hi> and the Tythes being well in them, they may well grant it to <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> paying 5 <hi>s.</hi> and con≈øtant payment being alledged ever ≈øince, 'tis a good Title.</p>
               <p>As to the Deed, tis true, 'tis dated before the time of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; but yet 'tis pleadable becau≈øe 'tis a private Deed, and ≈øo need not be allowed in Eyre or in Courts of Record; for ≈øuch as are not to be pleaded unle≈øs allowed there, are only Grants of Franchi≈øes and Liberties from the King, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion of the Deed to be beyond Memory, and the con≈øtant pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 5 <hi>s.</hi> is a ≈øufficient title to the Plaintiff if the Deed is not pleadable, and if it is, then 'tis a good di≈øcharge that way.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:172213:167"/>
               <p>And as to the Objection, that the <hi>Modus</hi> is payable to a wrong per≈øon; there are many ≈øuch which are not paid to the Par≈øon of the Pari≈øh, but to Lay-men: But in this Ca≈øe it doth appear that there was a <hi>Modus</hi> in the Prior, which being received till it came to the Crown, 'tis good although now paid to others; ≈øo that for that rea≈øon the Spiritual Court ought to be prohibited, and of that Opinion was all the Court; for if a <hi>Modus</hi> be paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, who hath the Right of the Tythes, though it be not to the Par≈øon of the Pari≈øh, 'tis well enough, e≈øpecially where the Plaintiff (as here) alledgeth it to be <hi>Portio Decimarum</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prior, ≈øo that it cannot be ≈øaid that the Par≈øon hath not <hi>quid pro quo;</hi> for he had nothing at fir≈øt.</p>
               <p>This Compo≈øition was made with the Prior, and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is only to ≈øhew payment to him, and to tho≈øe who have his Right.</p>
               <p>And as to the date of the Deed, 'tis pleadable though time out of memory, becau≈øe 'tis a private Deed; but Grants of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi≈øes and Liberties mu≈øt be allowed in Eyre; and ≈øo is my Lord <hi>Rolls</hi> to be under≈øtood in his Abridgment; Whereupon Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was affirmed.</p>
